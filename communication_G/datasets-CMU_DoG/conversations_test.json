Taking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys pretend to be lifeless whenever\nhumans are present, the film's plot focuses on the relationship between Woody, an old-fashioned\npullstring cowboy doll (voiced by Tom Hanks), and Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut action figure\n(voiced by Tim Allen), as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of Andy, their owner,\nto friends who work together to be reunited with Andy as his family prepares to move to a new\nhome. The screenplay was written by Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen and Alec\nSokolow, based on a story by Lasseter, Pete Docter, Stanton and Joe Ranft.

Dunkirk portrays the evacuation from three perspectives: land,\nsea, and air. It has little dialogue, since Nolan sought to create suspense from cinematography\nand music. Filming began in May 2016 in Dunkirk and ended that September in Los Angeles,\nwhen post-production began. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot the film on IMAX 65 mm\nand 65 mm large format film stock. Dunkirk has extensive practical effects, using thousands of\nextras, boats that participated in the evacuation, and period aeroplanes.",
