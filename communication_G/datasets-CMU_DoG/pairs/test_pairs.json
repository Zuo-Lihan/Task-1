He has an affair with a\nwoman named Naomi Lapaglia. When his wife finds out, they divorce, and he marries\nNaomi. Meanwhile, the SEC and the FBI begin investigating Stratton Oakmont. Jordan\nillegally makes $22 million in three hours upon securing the IPO of Steve Madden. This\nbrings him and his firm to the attention of the FBI. To hide his money, Jordan opens a Swiss\nbank account with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel in the name of Naomi's Aunt Emma,\nwho is a British national and thus outside the reach of American authorities. He uses the\nwife and in-laws of his friend Brad Bodnick, who have European passports, to smuggle the\ncash into Switzerland.\n1 In 1987, Jordan Belfort procures a job as a Wall Street stockbroker for L.F. Rothschild,\nemployed under Mark Hanna, who quickly entices him with the sex and drugs fueled\nstockbroker culture and teaches him that a stockbroker's only job is to make money for\nhimself. Jordan soon finds his career terminated following Black Monday and takes a job at\na boiler room brokerage firm on Long Island that specializes in penny stocks. Thanks to his\naggressive pitching style and the high commissions, Jordan makes a small fortune.",
