        "answer": "It comes with a 220volt 50 amp male plug. It also comes with an adapter that is 220volt 50 amp female to 120 volt 20 amp. It can run on both voltages. Personally I cut the plug right off and installed my own 3 wire 220 volt 30 amp twist lock connector to adapt to what I already had at my shop"

        "question": "Do I need a dual bevel miter to use this effectively? I can understand it giving me the correct angles for one side of a corner, but what about the other?",
        "answer": "M. Rees, No, you don't need a dual bevel saw to use this tool, but one would give you more capability. The tool measures the corner and gives you the saw settings to cut each piece of molding so that each piece makes up one-half of the corner joint. Because one corner cut will be left handed and the other right handed, you have to change either the saw settings (left/right miter/bevel, but the same number of degrees) and/or the position the molding is held on the saw to make the correct cut. There are several websites that explain cutting and installing crown molding. www.altereagle.com/How_to_install.html www.extremehowto.com/xh/article.asp?article_id=60354 Some of the miter saw manufacturers have instructions on their site."

        "answer": "If you're asking whether one unit can independantly control two separate heating/cooling zones, the answer is no. For two zones, you'll need to purchase two thermostats. I've just completed a two zone installation in my home this weekend. Be aware that, unlike the Nest, these units do not communicate in any way with each other. Thus, for instance, when unit one is heating it will show both heat and fan active, but the other unit will show both as idle."

        "answer": "Providing you have a good draft; 1) Well seasoned firewood is key. the only sure way to know for sure is to use a Firewood Moisture Meter to test the moisture content in firewood. If your fire isn't burning well and continually needs attention like poking the fire or opening the door to get the fire going then it's very likely that your firewood isn't seasoned well. 2) Try splitting the firewood into smaller pieces and loading the wood stove with more smaller pieces than a few large ones. 3) Certain firewood puts out more BTUs than others. In most areas there isn't much of a choice but when you do have a choice try to get the firewood that produces a higher BTU output. IE: Oak is better than pine. 4) If your chimney has a slow draft you may need to clean the chimney."

        "answer": "Hi Lauren, I'm really not sure. My cabinet base is 27 1/4 and I do have about 1 1/2 - 2 inches extra on each side. So it does not hit the inside walls of the cabinet. The inside of the sink is 20 inches across and 16 inches back to front. So the rim is about 1 1/2 inch around which is hidden by sink being under-mounted so dimensions say 23 inches by 18. So it's very close to your sink base size. You may want to give Kraus a call. If these are new cabinets your kitchen designer may know best because you really don't want to alter the sink base to much since it needs support. You also have to take into consideration too the sink is 10 inches deep and if undermounted under granite your sink will be 11 1/4 inch deep without bottom grate. The grate that it comes with is great (if you use it) will then bring the depth up about an inch. I love how deep the sink is. If you use a garbage disposal make sure that the height underneath in sink base will fit also since the sink is deep. My garbage disposal fit just fine. Best of luck. It's a great sink."

When I took it down (attached with heavy duty Velcro) the cover for the motion sensor fell inside the cover, don't know what happened, but I replaced it with the Mr Beam one. This has only one (new style) LED, but it's one of the new super bright (yellow when off) LEDs and it shines down on the slanted white section of the front, and reflects (some what) off that to spread the light more. Works OK in the gun safe, but can't brag much about it, and haven't had them long enough to say they last long. The light is bright, however. Hope this answers your question, know it's a long winded reply..."

Carefully grip the round cover and turn it counter clockwise while pulling it toward you-it is a friction fit and should come off easily. A pair of rubber nitrile gloves can help you \"get a grip\" -do not use any metal tool like pliers or a screwdriver as the cover is light duty and easily damaged Once you remove the cover, you will see the 2 phillips screws that hold the latch together.

Anyway, I find my filters to last at least six months and seem to be effective for almost a year..."

        "answer": "I don't know since I have stainless steel racks. Our kitchen has no stainless steel in it, so I was a little concerned about stainless steel racks in the almond enameled sink. My concern was unfounded. First off, the racks sit at the bottom of the sink and are not noticeable at all unless you are standing at the sink. For what it's worth, the reason for getting racks in the first place is to avoid scratching the enamel sink. Buying racks with a coating of any kind seems only to perpetuate the scratching problem by protecting the sink but pretty much guaranteeing the racks will scratch over time. When you consider that your sink strainer is most likely stainless steel anyhow, stainless racks fit right in. Whichever rack you buy, I think you'll find it will be one of the smartest purchases you've ever made."

        "answer": "Hi Richard, All I can tell you about the product is what I said in my review. I would think it could be used on redwood. But I don't know for sure. Look on the can and if you can't find the answer then call the company or ask someone at Lowe's or Home Depot. Be sure to get their answer in writing for your benefit. I know you're not suppose to apply it to a new deck. You need to wait for the wood to dry out. The stain with the sand is sticking fairly well on our deck floor but the regular stain without the sand is horrible. I contacted the company 5/14/13 and the manager didn't get back to me. I have contacted again 5/17/13 and a different employee promised to handle it for me because he claimed the manager was out of the office after that first day 5/14/13 when I first contacted them and he was still out. I forwarded the same email to the second employee at Synta which contained pictures of my deck which the manager asked for. They called me on 5/21/13 saying they couldn't open the pictures in my email. I resent it from a different email on the 21st and I am still waiting to hear from them. I bought my stain mostly from Lowe's and a little from Home Depot. I talked to Lowe's and they are the one's that told me to contact the company and I was told by the Lowe's employee, that if the company doesn't do anything Lowe's would take care of it. I feel the company should be responsible, not the store that sold it. I was also told by the second employee I spoke to from Synta that the stain usually only lasts about 3 years. I asked him, \"Then why do you warranty the stain for 10 years if it only lasts 3 years?\" He didn't have an answer for me. I am starting to think I am getting the run around from Synta. My suggestion to you is to try a different product. But read lots of customer reviews on any product you choose. There were not many reviews on Restore when we bought it. There are tons of bad reviews now. I remember reading a review that someone wrote about the poor customer service from Synta and that nothing was being done for them. Another reason I think I'm getting the shaft from Synta."

So if you use the table saw deck as a reference surface, then stick the gauge to the blade, it doesn't matter which direction you tilt the blade it will still measure the angle of change from the deck reference. Hope this helps."

The thing has a motion sensor in it so when you are away for a bit (not sure how long) it goes to the \"auto away\" setting and lets the temperature rise to the max that you allow under that setting. As soon as you go back upstairs you tap the thing and it kicks in. Before you install two of these I HIGHLY recommend having someone out to inspect you system and ensure you have enough 24V power to drive both units as they draw a fair bit of power. I've spend nearly $500 extra dollars on service calls and transformers to get both of my Nests to function properly."

OORRR... if you don't want to trim the excess and there's enough wall to keep the mesh spread out, you can just attach the velcro to the edges of the mesh to where it lands on the wall."

While we don't have brackish water (heavy limestone is our problem,) the filter has delivered above and beyond our expectations to softening the water. It doesn't mention brackish water, nor does any other filter I see on Amazon. However, http://www.alibaba.com/showroom/brackish-water-filter.html (website) shows a few filters that may help for you. If you are wanting to try something, I recommend this shower head filter. It's been wonderful for us, and we switched from another filter to this one. Hope this helps!"

        "answer": "I found this on the Internet. The Gerber website claims it is a 3-inch 7Cr17MoV steel blade. Another website describes 7Cr17MoV steel as the Chinese equivalent of the AISI 440A stainless steel. From the Customs Tactical website I found this description: \"440A is one of the workhorses of the Sports and Tactical Knife industry. The majority of entry level knives use either 440A, 420HC or AUS-6 steel. 440 is a medium carbon, martensitic stainless steel that is very corrosion resistant and extremely tough that can be hardened to about RC58. While not considered a premium knife steel, 440A still has some very good properties for cutlery use. It takes a very fine edge and will easily pop the hairs off your arm if heat treated properly, and is more corrosion resistant and tougher than 440B or 440C. 440A is rarely used by custom knifemakers, and is usually only used by production knife companies. Some of the Knife companies using this steel include Kershaw, Gerber and Buck. http://www.faq.customtacticals.com/steels/stainless_440a.php I honestly cannot say I know much about this blade but I have used it. It seems to keep a sharp edge and I was happy with the knife. A good, not great, knife for the money. As stated above, this knife is not a custom knife but is a production knife. Of course this should be understood for the price it is being sold for."

        "answer": "I loved this bulb when infirst got it but I have a few problems now. If you get the 2700K warmth it does get close to the yellow light of an incandescent bulb. My biggest issues are these 1. They are not all the same color. They have slightly different shades. This is common among LED bulbs. Difficult to notice differences when they are in lamps but when they are in a light fixture spaced inches apart it's evident. If recommend getting a few extra and returning the ones that don't match the others. 2. Mine buzz (only in my pendant like fixture) I changed the dinner but still buzzed) 3. As they age: 1 out of 8 have died and 2 have gotten dimmer than the others."

        "question": "where are danze faucets manufactured?",
        "answer": "Introduced to the U.S. in 2000, Danze is a name under which the Globe Union is growing a brand identity in the U.S. It is the most actively promoted of the many faucet, fixture and accessory brands owned by the gigantic Asian company controlled by the Ou-yang Ming family of Taichung, Taiwan. Globe Union is the dominant faucet manufacturer in Asia under its GOBO brand. Its faucets are made primarily in mainland Chinese factories by its subsidiary Shenzhen Globe Union Industrial Corp. of Shenzhen, China (with a small bow to Canada for some automatic faucets). Globe Union is a full line manufacturer. Its products range widely in quality, an effect of making products at every price point. Danze is positioned as Globe Union's upper tier faucet line. As a whole, the Danze line seems to be well made. The quality is very good for the price. Many of the faucets are very stylish, and while Globe Union in the past mostly copied existing European and American designs, the company has recently begun introducing its own styles and they are good, some are even excellent. Danze, unlike other Globe Union brands like Fusion, has been a marketing success, having grown to impressive proportions in a dozen years with hundreds of brick and mortar retailers and a strong internet presence. It has been so successful, in fact, that Globe Union appears to have made the decision to throw all of its marketing muscle behind Danze and phase out other, less successful brands. We can no longer find Ameristream faucets anywhere, although its showers are still available. Brands such as Water Ridge and Corrego are now for sale only by discounters: Water Ridge has become a Costco in-house brand, and Corrego is sold by Sam's Club. Other Globe Union faucet brands have been merged into the Danze line. The former Fusion Hardware Group, Inc. was disbanded by Globe Union in 2012 after selling its Door Hardware division to Schlage Locks along with the right to the Fusion brand name in 2010. The Fusion faucet collections, including Bella Villa, Colonial Crest, River Rock, Sonoma, South Beach, St. Charles, Samui, Lilly, and Bordeaux, have been taken over by Danze as of 2012. Many of these are starting to appear at deep discounts from internet retailers, suggesting they they are being phased out as existing supplies are exhausted. Globe Union seems to have conquered the parts and warranty issues that formerly plagued the company's products. Parts, warranty support and installation help are available from on-line sources and at 1-888-328-2383. Other than for general questions, you will need your brand name and model number to get any assistance. We have had reservations about the quality of Danze faucets in the past, but they are now largely gone. In the past we saw the occasional defect that suggested spotty quality control at the Chinese factories that make Danze, but we have not seen any lately. Our recent experience with the Danze line has been favorable. The product line contains a full range or faucets from economy to luxury, so it falls generally in the middle-high range of quality. American made faucets comparable to Danze include California Faucets, Delta, Elkay, and Moen"

Yes, it will stick to a surface if gravity is holding it to that surface; otherwise you will need something else. I used this stuff in my car so the extreme temperatures caused the 3M strip to not only come apart from it's mounting surface, but from the LEDs themselves. I bought some double sided tape from the hardware store and cut it to appropriate lengths and widths and haven't had problems since. Also, it really doesn't matter what kind of tape you use, if the surface is contoured it won't adhere for more than a day. If the lights are hidden, you can use clips to hold it in place. Your only option might be glue. I've used a lot of this stuff and love helping others do the same. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

        "answer": "I don't think it's possible to do what you want there...but keep in mind I'm no electrician. What I'm thinking you're describing is basically a light that has it's own control to half the power. The light switch simply sends the power to the unit or does not (when it's off). To the best of my knowledge, the only switch that could even come close to what you want is a dimmer type switch but as you may or may not know many \"lighting appliances\" warn that a dimmer switch cannot/should not be used with them. Even if it was ok, it would not instantly cut the power in half, you would have to approximate half if half was important to you, if it's simply dimming that would be nice to you...I would suggest checking the chandelier's installation instructions and see if they emphatically state that you cannot use a dimmer switch with it."

The temperature has been in the teens the past couple nights. You are probably looking at 14' of baseboard heaters max to one thermostat. Put them under windows if you can to increase the circulation and it puts a curtain of heat in front of the window. That's why I went with 5 footers plus the wattage thing. They are good thermostats. They keep the temperature pretty close to perfect."

        "answer": "Hi Dave, Good question. It's Stainless steel. In fact, it's 304 stainless steel. Here is a quick read about 304 Stainless: Grade 304 is the standard \"18/8\" stainless; it is the most versatile and most widely used stainless steel, available in a wider range of products, forms and finishes than any other. It has excellent forming and welding characteristics. The balanced austenitic structure of Grade 304 enables it to be severely deep drawn without intermediate annealing, which has made this grade dominant in the manufacture of drawn stainless parts such as sinks, hollow-ware and saucepans. I hope that answers your question. Thanks! Michael Weir Kitchen-Classics"

I purchased these separately as a kit (Webstone 44443WPR 3/4-Inch IPS Isolator EXP E2 Tankless Water Heater Service Valve Kit with Clean Brass Construction) from amazon for ~$100. One may also need to purchase a longer length of thermostat wire if the temperature control module will be placed further than 10 ft away from the unit. The unit was fairly easy to install if one has some basic electrical/plumbing knowledge. There is also a series of ~6 videos on youtube detailing installation of an outdoor rheem tankless hot water heater which I found helpful. I purchased this unit a couple months ago to place at my camp after my hot water heater died. This unit has worked perfectly and would definitely recommend this product"

I stack my lids upside down on my pans, stacking with the largest pan on the bottom and the smaller on the top. Type in \"storing pan lids\" on Google and click on the first link. I see your idea there, but there are also others. An 18\" door would only hold two lids. A closet door could handle the weight for this idea. I personally wouldn't do this on a cabinet door.

        "answer": "The less expensive model 111.335.00.5 is for installation in 6 inch deep walls. Note the different design of the more expensive version that enables the 4 inch waste pipe to run \"through\" the middle or the unit instead of the less expensive model where the waste pipe runs \"behind\" the frame, taking up more space. In addition to the waste pipe position, the more expensive version features Geberit's UP 720, which again is not as deep as the UP 360. If you don't already have 2x6 walls then installing the cheaper deeper version will mean you have to steal 2 inches from the wall on which your WC will hang. This could be beneficial if one of the shower walls shares the same wall - you could create a deeper more useable tiled niche."

        "answer": "I would say no. Anyway I would not recommend it. I tried it on 12\"X 12\" tiles and it didn't work well at all. The tiles would break not on the line I scored and sometimes were jagged. I would recommend a wet saw. There is nothing that cuts better than a wet saw. You can cut angles, notches, small pieces easily. The tile cutter score's the tile and than you have to try to snap the tile evenly the rest of the way. A wet saw cuts through the tile with a nice clean cut. I bought a Kobalt 7\" wet saw at Lowe's for my floor tiles for 189.00. It went through the tiles like paper. You can buy a wet saw for under 90.00 that should do what you need. The cheaper saw should be plenty for what you need. If you plan on using the saw again sometime in the future than get one like mine. The higher the price usually means better. The cheaper wet saws that I mentioned got good reviews and should be more than adequate for your 3\"X3\" tiles. You can buy a tile sizer to compliment the saw for 42.00 or less. This holds the tile so you can cut pieces of tile between 6 inches wide all the way down to almost nothing. You can look and see how it works at Amazon. You don't have to worry about fingers. I've never used one but I'm sure they work well. Sizer makes one. I bought the Md professional tile cutter because I never used a wet saw before and was intimidated in buying an electric wet saw. It was very easy to use, not intimidating at all. If you plan on using a cheaper wet saw check the reviews and buy accordingly. The reviews on the cheaper wet saws they are cutting through 12\" and 18\" tiles. They are good for a 3\" tile also. You are not saying what a handmade ceramic tile is. I do not know what your handmade tiles are, but I assume they are fairly strong and have the same consistency as a regular tile and won't crumble when you cut them. If they are the same consistency as a regular ceramic tile the wet saw will work. Are you worried about the 3\" size or are you worried that handmade tiles might be delicate. If you can cut them with a grinder and they don't just crumble than you can cut them with a wet saw. You can cut mosaic, ceramic, porcelain, glass, etc. with a wet saw."

If you blow up the pictures on the Little Giant ladders it is compatible with, you will see aluminum block sockets on the ladder that this plugs into. I ordered one for a LG ladder that was not compatible and had trouble figuring out why since my ladder looked exactly like the compatible ladders. I'm sure it was a liability issue since providing brackets have required some drilling into the existing ladder. It is also possible there is more internal reinforcement in the ladder at that attachment point ... so you can blame the lawyers for LG not providing brackets. In my previous research I did come across one person that fabricated brackets ... but it sounded like he did some machining of some block aluminum to do that."

The panel it comes with is only 1/3 the power required to run the system. It is a 10W panel and you need 30W. They will happily sell you additional panels. The batteries are also worthless. The system has no way to charge them. You actually need to connect them to an external charger to do this. The solar won't charge them. They will also sell you a solar charging module. In the end I removed the solar and the batteries and have it wired to A/C power. Oh and another thing, I have replaced the main control board 3 times since I bought it. The customer service to make this happen as horrible. I am now out of warranty and if the system dies I will simply spend the money and replace it with a higher quality one. Now I am basing this on the kit I purchased 2 years ago. It would be nice if they have changed it but I would not count on it. I hope this helps."

You use the awl with the twisted shaft to enlarge the hole after you have removed the nail or other item that punctured your tire. Then take the lubricant that is provided and lubricate the hole using the awl. After the hole has been lubricated You thread a fiber plug into the needled shaft and insert it into the puncture until half of the material is in the tire then twist the shaft one quarter turn and withdraw the shaft and cut the protruding material even with the surface of the tire with a razor blade and the repair should be complete."

It is really hard to know what each wire is. Typically, the Red and white usually connect to the power, blue to the light (dimming is done usually through the remote receiver) at this point there is usually 1 more wire for the motor. You have 3 left that is because your fan reverses via the remote. You can buy the correct one that reverses on amazon or ebay or try to Google the wiring diagram.

        "answer": "If memory serves me correctly the manufacturer suggests changing them at a six month interval. I would imagine that would be driven by two things, the capacity of the filter to do just that - filter, and I'm guessing here but perhaps the propensity of contaminants (e.g. mold) to grow on any surface that has become moist. Keep in mind that I am speculating on the second driver. So, if you have a typical family (which I'm sure is what the time frame is based on) I'd suggest changing the filter at Thanksgiving and July 4th, which are easily remembered dates and approximately six months apart. I happen to live by myself so I tend to change mine when I remember (I really should write it down, perhaps on the back of the mirror of the medicine cabinet) but let it go for longer than six months. I can say that I have never noticed a problem. I've had mine for at least four years. And yes I mean the filter head, not an individual filter cartridge. Hope that helps you Jenna."

When I try to poke the tip of a sharp knife straight through the weave only 1/8 inch pokes through. It could go through the glove and cut you but it wouldn't go very deep. And you would really have to work to get a knife or other sharp object at an angle that would cause it to go through the glove. Also the weave is a bit thicker, the links overlap slightly, when the glove is relaxed, giving you more protection. When the glove stretches over your hand as you are using it, it opens up to a single link but this stops most sharps just fine. Hope this helps!"

It can withstand wet weather conditions but it is not designed for scuba diving. As a scuba diver myself, I know how important safety is while underwater. As much as I would love to recommend our product to you, I'm not sure it would suit your needs as a scuba diver. I hope that helps! Should you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us at the customer service link below. Thanks! All the best, Kendall / The Friendly Swede"

So double check this light's nanometer spectrum of light before buying. I'm thinking this model would detect mold. However, I'm not sure what color mold fluoresces. The tough part is so many things light up sometimes you don't know what you're looking at. Comet (the cleaner) fluoresces. Lots of minerals in cleaning solutions glow. Glue. Lint. It's pretty dizzying in certain areas. I found that the \"pattern\" of whatever is glowing is just as important - if not more - than the glow. Mice and rat urine trails almost always start with a wider more circular area then \"trail\" in a direction while diminishing in presence. I would think mold, undetectable in natural light, would glow in a pattern that looks like mold growth. Hope this helps and good luck."

        "answer": "If you are cutting your 16\" Birch square (90 degrees) then you can also just lift the front of the board slightly (about an inch or so) to finish your cut. You have to be careful that the back of the board remains seated against the fence and remains flat to the table. I've been using this method for nearly 20 years with my Makita LS 1211 which only crosscuts about 14\". If you aren't cutting square then you have to flip the board over AND switch it from end to end to finish your cut. That can get tricky if you only have 1/4\" of board left to cut."

However -I've started and run this pump from a little 7 amp 12 volt batteries that are use in alarm panel and such. they sell the 7 amp at like radio shack and home depot. i get them from work as well as 24 amp size too. the 7 amps I usually use when i only have to pump 5 gallons or so-works fine for that -then i top off charge the 7 amp... the 24 amp battery's use for other chores. when I have large pumping chores i hook up to a regular deep cycle battery. so your 30 amp should have no problem running the pump -but how long is another question. also if you do use your 30 amp and its NOT a deep cycle battery i'm sure you will kill it if you run it for extended period - (say a regular garden tractor battery is just for starting purposes and not extended running.) i tried to give you as much information as possible as i could i don't have the pump locally with me to read the spec label or put a amp gauge.

You need at least 15 watts to get the proper color balance and cover most of the plant. like in my case grass seed for my cats in a planter.

Wallyworld, and the common 'big box stores' would not likely have this (weird) key blank. A shop devoted to locksmithing would be the best bet on sourcing a key(s). This key blank is very uncommon as you've probably found. There exists absolutely no 'brand' markings at all, just \"7306\" (on my key) which would be the cut code. It is also a double cut key, as you can see. A real 'brand X'. Even the head of the key is a PITA. I had to drill out the silly narrrow slot to get it on my key ring. I wish you luck!"

        "answer": "A quick answer is, I don't know. I don't have ringworm or a suitable fluor around 360 nm to test it on. However, the Woods lamp that is used in vet offices etc has a rough range of 330-390 nm with an optimal wavelength around 365. It appears this works well for most ringworm that can be analyzed this way (bearing in mind that not all ringworms fluoresce or are diagnosed this way). The LED in question is 395 nm, which is about 30 from the Woods lamp optimum. Since most uv lights have a range of at leeast 10-30 nm, this one might work, but again, it might not. It is inexpensive, and can detect scorpions by the manufacturers demo, so maybe it would work. There is probably a difference in intensity from the woods lamp, since that one is a higher power, though the LED (and 21 of those) are pretty intense also...Its cheap enough that if it didn't work, you've lost $9, $15 with shipping...sorry I can't be more specific and say yes. But it really depends on the ringworm and at what wavelength it fluoresces...I did medline and pubmed searches but couldn't find anything more specific."

If anything, the \"glass\" is a smidge cloudier than when they were brand new straight out of the box (and after a whole year of use), but they still look good and give off good light. Best solar fixtures I've ever purchased. I'm very happy with them."

        "answer": "This pump is designed to pump liquids. The models with a vertical magnetic float switch, such as my 257, are not recommended for effluent applications. They recommend using a tethered float switch for that so you can get longer cycle times. Also, if you plan on pumping any solid waste, you really need a sewage ejector pump that has an impeller designed to handle solids. Liberty makes these as does Zoeller."

If you sink the corner post and set the laser on top then stop the head from spinning (theres a button to stop it) you can shoot a straight line. I don't know how far the receiver will continue to pick up the laser, the furthest I have ever gone from the head unit is about two hundred feet.

        "answer": "Sorry, can you say what the 2260 is? In general, it's possible to run identical panels in parallel, although there are some risks if they aren't generating exactly the same voltage. Typically, circuits with two generator sources (batteries, for example, but solar panels follow the same basic rules) use some mechanism to deal with different voltage outputs. The simplest is to just put a small-value resistor or diode in series with each generator to prevent the one with higher voltage from damaging the other. On your second question (car + solar), I don't know for sure, but I don't think it's a good idea, because your car's alternator will produce a higher voltage than these panels, and they will look like a load to the alternator, running current backward through them. That's probably not a good thing. As before, you could put diodes in series with the panels to prevent \"reverse bias\" and possible damage to the panels. I'm not actually aware of products that you could use for this purpose for cars. It's probably a bit too sophisticated for such a \"low tech\" application (stuff like this exists for solar systems for home power). But diodes should work fine. I think somebody in one of the reviews or questions mentioned a solution like this. It's cheap and easy (parts available from Radio Shack, for example)."

Then it's out of the electrical circuit until the next start up. It's common to add a hard start to and older compressor that IS having a problem on start up. The comp is old, internal clearances are larger and it needs a kick to get it started. It's not uncommon for an new \"tight\" compressor to need one also.

Know that I am merely pointing you to the manufacturer's website which is the entity that makes this claim / statement.

Always use extreme caution and common sense when wiring / connecting 110-volt 60-Hz hardware in a moist/wet environment.

I doubt you could move that mounting clip to the short side & mount that way & have the doorbell chime work properly, because there doesn't appear to be any way for the clip to hang securely on the doorbell frame; and I doubt the chime piston would function well if the metal doorbell structure was mounted sideways which would mean the chime piston had to strike sideways instead of vertical. Of course you could call the manufacturer & ask their customer service. We no longer have the install instructions. Perhaps the manufacturer has a \"vertical mount\" model--I don't know.

        "answer": "The M18 Red Lithium compact battery, 48-11-1815, works with the saw. I'm not sure about the 48-11-1820, which is the 2.0 version of the same compact battery. I expect it will work. Milwaukee advertises the compact battery pack will not work with the sawzall. They claim you need the full size red lithium battery. This is not correct. When I considered buying the sawzall, I already had a drill & driver set with 3 compact batteries. I wanted to use the same batteries with the sawzall. I contacted Milwaukee to determine if the compact batteries would work with the sawzall. They initially said no, then finally confirmed it would work. They said they discouraged people from using the compact battery since the sawzall has a heavy power usage and the compact batteries do not last long with the sawzall. Personally, I prefer the compact battery over the full size battery. The compact batteries are much lighter and easier to work with over the entire day. The batteries charge quickly. With the drill / driver combo, I will work in the morning, charge the batteries over lunch, work in the afternoon and charge again in the evening. With the sawzall, I will use one battery til it goes dead (approx. 30 min), pop in a different battery and put the dead battery on the charger. By the time the new battery is dead, the battery on the charger is recharged and I swap them out. In several years I've had very few times where the compact battery goes dead and I cannot continue working. If I will not have access to an electrical outlet for the charger in my work area, then I charge all three batteries beforehand and plan accordingly."

So I would say that it would slip right through the hole in this holster. It was intended for the big maglite D cell battery flashlights. But there are lots of people making flashlight holsters these days since the LED flashlight craze started a few years ago, so I think you'll find one if you keep looking. But this is definitely too big!!"

The regular candle is 3.5\" in diameter in the 5\" and 7\" size, whereas the deluxe is 4\" in diameter in these sizes. (I think for the 9\" candle, both types are 4\" in diameter.) But I think the main difference is the texture of the candle. Both are wax, but the regular is smooth and the deluxe has some texture, seems more like a real candle. The deluxe comes in the round white box and the regular is in the square black box. I am answering this from the point of having bought several of these (LOVE THEM). I cannot smell, so can't speak to the scent of each, but I read somewhere that the scent differs a little, too."

If I stand in the middle, and aim the control in-between the bedside lamps which are on opposite sides of a king-size bed, I can control both lamps at the same time from about 7 ft. away. However these bulbs remember their last setting, so if you use them say throughout a living room, once you set them they'll stay that way when you turn them on again."

        "answer": "Personal opinion is I wouldn't us this on a motorcycle, it's a thin plastic box and will most like be visible (not attractive to look at).. It works good and can support Output power: 5V&lt;40W,12V&lt;96W,24V&lt;192W. So you will need to add up how much W your lights will need. If you don't care about Looks or can hid it (which may prevent the wireless part from working haven't tried that) it should handle the load fine, but check the needed output from your lights. You bike is probably not a 12V battery either so that will limit it, as I'm sure you want your bike to start as well. Hope that answers your question"

MERV means Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value which was developed by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioner Engineers - ASHRAE. MERV values vary from 1 to 16. The higher the MERV value is the value the more efficient the filter will be in trapping airborne particles. Another consideration is air flow through the your HVAC system. Leaving a dirty air filter in place or using a filter that is too restrictive may result in low air flow and possibly cause the system to malfunction."

As I recall, there is a threaded pipe with @ least 2 inches of thread. You put the lock washer on and run up the nut to secure. As far as the water lines which are about 3 feet long, how far away is the incoming water? Your probably OK but if need be, you could buy an extension. TIP - I found it was very helpful to color code the water lines on the small picture showing the setup connections.The connection diagram was very small and when black lines cross black lines its too easy to make a mistake.

        "answer": "I just received this tote-able toilet seat and found out why there is so much confusion about fitting these onto a bucket. Perhaps some of them are a little easier but mine seemed impossible. I weigh over 250 and I was unable to press the seat onto the bucket in any way shape or form. Then I discovered the secret on mine was to not press the seat onto the bucket but to press the bucket onto the seat! After doing it this way I was able to fit the lid onto every bucket I had in my house which included buckets from Aubuchon, Walmart, VIP, and Home Depot. A small person may need to improvise with added weight or the help of a second person but this is how it worked for me: 1) Lay the seat onto firm but soft flat surface (carpet) upside down with the lid opening tab facing away from you and the hinge toward you. 2) Loosely place the bucket upside down onto the center ring of the seat with the bucket handle lined up with the seat lid tab (away from the hinge). 3) Kneeling behind the hinge of the seat lay your chest on the bucket so the bucket lip closest to you pushes into the seating ring first. 4) Slowly rock your weight forward pushing the lip of the bucket into the ring working both sides toward the front. You can run your fingers behind seam as it closes but do not let your weight get in front of the seam or the back will pop back out. 5) As the rear and sides of the bucket lip slide into the seating ring you will be able to look down at the front of the bucket and see the lip bulging out over approximately 6 inches of the front of the ring when it is almost seated. 6) When the lip is no longer slipping into the seating ring, smack the bulging part with your fist or a rubber mallet, which will pop it into place with an audible snap."

[If your fan and panel are NOT that close you may need to buy/extend the two wire/cable. Plus with full sun we can hear the fan running in the bedroom below, but is NOT very loud and only in the day time. Also we had to use cut down, scrap 2\" X 4\" boards to \"pad\" down the 3\" bigger square vent grill to make it fit the fan unit and be air tight, which of course did NOT show from the outside and we made the vent removable with 4 screws and caulking for outside access to avoid the attic insulation and long crawl space to get to that end.] During a new roof install the roofer noted this fan would have worked better if we had the correct eave vents vs. the side wall vents on each end wall for roof longevity AND for removing excess heat. [The small solar panel was easily removed/unplugged to put on the new roof.] The 70 deg. Temp. cut off Sensor stops the unit from working in the colder months which was an extra $16... http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YVUOO/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 AS ALL WAYS - SAFETY FIRST WITH LADDERS AND ROOF WALKING !!!

Wood and metal are both on the list so it would seem logical they would bond real nice. The fact it was useful outdoors as well as indoors sold me and it worked well bonding the metal chimney vent to the brick flu without a problem. It has been in place for almost a year now so that is a good sign it carries the adhesive properties I was looking for. If you are using this indoors only, Liquid Nails might have another product that would be cheaper in price but carry the strong bonding properties you are looking for.

        "answer": "Jay I have 4 of these Might Mules for several years now. I am going to give you my answer that worked after I vent. Mighty Mule has an advantage because of market share -- the clicker, parts, batteries, etc. all at Home Depot, Tractor Supply, etc. And they have been reasonably reliable. I can see from the DVR and magazine size instruction booklet that they have had customers provide feedback that the user interface is not \"5 star\". At least it is not for me. I think I finally assumed in the black and white documentation that black meant black and white meant red and put the black into the insert toward the top and red (or positive if using different color wire) is beneath it. I think I reversed it once and the good thing is it just blows the fuse which is easy to change. Another good thing is you have the 500 which is way easier to deal with than the 350 by far. I have two other things to add. When the thing starts beeping at some point (and it will) the first guess is always the battery, they go out between 1-2 years. Sometimes it will jam and it will be necessary to unhook the arm and manually screw it in a few rounds or so to get it unjammed then hold the close set button down to clear then reset the closed position. Reading the beep sequence guide in the manual was, for me, interesting. I hope Mighty Mule has a social media group that reads these posts and will see I am not flaming them. If I bought a 5th unit it would be a Mighty Mule. BUT, I would pay them $100 to get a \"500 Plus\" for which there was an LED read out of status, well marked and easier interfaces. I have to pull out the manual every time one of my 4 goes on the blink. Come on Mighty Mule ... congrats on achieving market share dominance now fortify it by improving user interface. Hire someone from Apple engineering to oversee moving to a more fool proof (I am the fool here, not Jay) interface."

I work in the TV/Film business and it's true that on a below freezing day when I'm handling aluminum pipe they get cold pretty quickly, but when it's snowing/raining they can keep my hands dry for hours. So if cold is the only problem then these aren't the gloves for you but if you have to work in the wet, they are great and really do still give a decent grip even on wet slippery surfaces."

        "answer": "this one by far, long and away. hands down, no contest. the length of, and pivot point (elbow bend to handle), is so different on matters of physics and my actual personal experience. It's also a well made heavy duty and heavy tool. I bought this specifically for a motorcycle wheel i couldn't get off and had broken a two quality (but obviously wrong) tools on trying to get it off. this thing took it off so easy, with so little pressure from me, that my whole world view changed. A few months later a friend called with a flat and i brought it just in case and i was again very impressed with the physics power of this thing. In that situation I we had a 4-way and it failed to break 2 of the lug nuts and so i broke out the 24 inch and they came off like butter. ___NOW!!!! the only down side is that you will need to buy a socket bit that fits this bar (it's 1/4 inch drive and not the usual, house hold 3/8 inch)....and also the socket bits that fit your needs/lugnuts/whatever... and this may include needing to get 'deep socket' set or bit. They are cheaper to buy a set off of amazon than in a hardware store and it's usually safer to just get the 'deep' since they work on all bolts and nuts...they're just a little heavy. You might also want to pick up some adaptors for both ways so your you can use all your socket wrenches with all the bits. you need a 1/4 inch to 3/8 and a 3/8 to1/4, you can skip the latter if you want but i'd really suggest getting the 1/4 inch to 3/8 so you can use this big bad boy with all your sockets. good luck and please don't hesitate to ask anymore questions."

        "question": "Why is a \"jumper\" needed on the other 3 way switch? How come the other traveler wire isn't connected?",
        "answer": "I am not an electrician, but if you google \"PLS750C1000 manual\" you can see the wiring diagram for an Existing 3-way Install and follow as I try to describe why a jumper is needed. Starting from the right hand 3-way, power comes to the switch, is jumpered across the Common terminal and the Traveler terminal that goes to the timer switch's Line (black) wire. In effect, this bypasses the right hand 3-way providing constant power to the timer's Line, regardless of the 3-way's switch position. The 3-way's other Traveler terminal connects to the timer's 3-way (yellow) wire, and the 3-way switch basically acts like a single pole (regular on/off) switch. If you look at the electrical flow, it goes into the 3-way's Common terminal, then depending on whether the 3-way is switched one way or the other, power either goes to the timer's 3-way (yellow) wire or does not go. That is, the yellow wire is either \"on\" or \"off\". (For what it's worth, when the yellow wire is off, power is going through both the switch and jumper to the timer's Line (black) wire. When the yellow is on, power is going through only the jumper to the timer's Line (black) wire.) I have not confirmed this with Honeywell, but I believe the timer looks at its 3-way (yellow) wire for a change of state. When there is a change of state on the timer's 3-way (yellow) wire (from off to on, or from on to off), the timer sees that change and changes the state of the load from whatever it is currently to its opposite (That is, from on to off or from off to on). So, hopefully that answers why the jumper is needed on the other 3-way switch. And that also kind of answers why both travelers are not connected as they would be normally. It's basically because of the timer's design. I hope this helps. If not, I would do as another respondent suggested and call or email Honeywell. They were good at timely answering a wiring question I had, since my setup matches neither their Existing 3-way nor their New 3-way diagrams precisely."

Majority of issues with low end (cheaper) is abuse- doing big boy jobs w/4 foot breakers. That and/or a lousy mounting on the wrong surface, can't blame mfr when things break loose, including the undersized vise, only not as they hoped they could get away with. I have to fair. I always look for a deal/best price but some things i will not compromise on: quality of my tools or accepting what a mfr claims their product is capable of without documentation and then try to exceed those limits.

If the unit was mounted lower than what I have (10-12 ft) it may activate easier since the sensor will be closer to the target motion. The mount angle can be easily adjusted to allow for a slight pitch more than what is already engineered into it. Not sure of the adjustment range. Remember the light offers a dim light normally which may act as a deterent, but may just aid the racoon in finding its target, food? I wanted lighting that would allow me travel in my wheelchair. There is no sensitivity adjustment that I am aware of except for distance."

Specifically, some dimmer settings cause some flicker. But all you have to do is raise or lower the dimmer and it's easy to find a setting that causes no flicker. I agree that it's best to use a dimmer switch designed for LEDs, but in a pinch, this one could work."

You will simply cut the whips to the length needed for your diameter pipe. If you want to save a bit, loosen the head, slide the whips through to the length you need on one side. That will leave a much longer length on opposite side. When cut to size, you should have enough whip material left over to refill the system when you wear out the first set."

        "answer": "It is possible, but you will want to check with Chamberlain first to see if it requires a repeater kit. In 2007 they introduced a new security scheme, and Homelink provided compatible equipment, but not all car manufacturers started using it right away. In fact, as late as 2011 some car makers were still using the old Homelink technology that would not work with the new Chamberlain stuff \"out of the box\". So you will want to confirm with both Chamberlain and Chevrolet if your year and model car will be able to transmit the new codes. If not, there is an add-on repeater that will receive your Homelink signal and translate it to the new Chamberlain security codes, but it is about $50 retail itself. However, this unit IS what you would be looking for to attach to your gate opener to receive signals from your Homelink or a remote. Sorry I can't give a more definitive answer, but there are a lot of variables. May be better to buy one locally that you can return easily if you cannot get your Homelink to work with it."

        "question": "I don't have a basement, can this be stored outside? Are there other suggestions for placement?",
        "answer": "Yes, HDPE is UV stable and used for outdoor water tanks. The main issue is freezing. If your emergency water is a block of ice, you can't use it until it thaws. If you have space outdoors and freezing is not an issue, then you should look at other HDPE water tanks which hold more and/or are less expensive. You are paying a premium for this tank because it is designed to be as large as possible and still fit through a 30\" wide residential doorway. If you don't need to pass through a 30\" doorway, there are better choices. If you don't have room indoors and freezing is an issue, then another option is an underground tank but it would need to be buried below the frost line to avoid freezing, and you need some kind of pump to bring the water up out of the ground."

One small thing you can do tho, is buy a water restrictor or cut a rubber washer to fit the hot and cold lines. That will reduce the flow of hot and cold and thus reduce the pressure. If you use the handheld shower mostly, you can buy a shower head water restrictor (they are literally only $1.00... go to True Value... Home Depot and Lowes don't sell oddly enough!), and they restrict shower flow to 2.5 gallons per minute which is green and eco-conscious! But the restrictor will literally restrict / lessen the flow and the pressure.... ;-)"

However you need a better handle on your airflow requirements. I suspect you need a larger more utilitarian fan. You also may not need a finished decorator faceplate for utility service. This is more important if in a hot climate (outside heat-gain), welding or expect engine exhaust fumes. \""

I'd question perhaps your unit is faulty? If you blow gently on the orifice (straw) size opening you should feel/hear the bladder inside move to engage the switch. If it's stuck, then it would stay on after the furnace shuts off. Mark's idea of sealing could also be an issue. I'm using it with the 530 CFM inline Tjernlund 6 inch inline booster.

As you turn the dial from mid position to the end on the women's side a second nozzle about 1 inch to the left of the first nozzle comes down and squirts water approximately 1 inch below the first one. In other words the men's side hits at one spot where as women's side hits two spots one inch apart and cleans a larger length of the opening. In case of using a single nozzle a person may have to move forward and backward if he/she feels the nozzle did not hit and clean the entire opening."

I wouldn't recommend this tile in a food prep space because it can't be cleaned - it will harbor bacteria and other debris.

Here at Amazon, you want something like this, which is pretty easy to implement: http://www.amazon.com/Converter-Module-12v-20v-Supply-Adapter/dp/B00OTQWK9U/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1428944314&sr=8-8&keywords=12v+to+6v+power+regulator I think I will go buy one of these for myself today, thanks for bringing this up!

        "answer": "Hello sir, First of all no question is stupid especially if it gets you out of a bind. Yes, the batteries are to be placed in the aft end (the screw cap opposite the bulb) of the unit if it is like a standard maglite. I shipped mine down to Haiti and did not open them up but I have had many others and they always opened up from that end and there is no reason to believe they go in the bulb end as there is a mechanism for the switch and the bulb socket on that side. The positive side with the nipple goes toward the bulb. If this is a new unit and never has had batteries this is unusual but as the other guy said it can be very, very tight when new. If it is a used unit that someone gave you and it has batteries in it the possibility exists that the batteries exploded from heat and the corrosive affects of the chemicals has jammed the threads of the end cap. This happened to me a couple of times here in south Florida in a hot work van over the summer. Try to coat the threads with something not to heavy (light grease or a nickel or copper based never seez compound come to mind) in the future. This will help."

The blue is good for clearing up acne and the red helps cell regeneration and reduces inflammation. It really works!!! Its amazing!!! I couldn't afford the $300+ led therapy wands sold in health and beauty so I researched online and got the idea from videos on you tube. Its been studied by Nasa and the military uses it for combat wounds.sorry to go on and on but I never imagined it would work so well. Hope this helps"

HORRIBLE buzzing, I took the bulbs back to the big box retailer immediately. After much trouble shooting, including testing other bulbs... I realized the low load was the problem. 75w equivilant (13.5w) CREE LED bulbs got rid of the buzzing. FYI: my fixture requires 5 bulbs. I need a minimum of 60 watts total to keep the buzzing at bay in that fixture. I had the same issue in a 3 bulb fixture that needs a minimum of 40 watts."

It has to be supported from the bottom and either made flush to the counter top or to be installed under the counter top, as mine is. The front of the sink is 9\" high, but the bowl itself is about 1/2 to 5/8\" higher, or deeper. Also this style of sink can come out into the kitchen, or away from the back splash at least 2\" or more, then the drop of the bowl will limits the protrusion. My contractor used two 2x4's under the sink, one on either side to support my sink, works great and doesn't interfere with the water hoses, or the dishwasher hookup. Again, get the sink to your house, then find out what the best install is for your needs. Good Luck"

The remotes have a battery and you may need to unscrew a plate to access/replace the batteries and set the code. The only real trick in this is being sure that you set the code switches on the remote exactly the same way they are set on the receiver. (My experience was that after I purchased the multicode, it turned out that I needed to replace the circuit board (which was impossible to find for a 25 yo motor) and I ended up returning the multicode and having a new motor installed c. $400 in central NJ.)"

Naturally the 4 Ah batteries will last much longer than the 3 Amp-hour batteries, and since the size and weight of the batteries is the same, the DCD985M2 is a superior drill. The DCD985B is the bare drill only, without any batteries or charger. The part number DCD985 is not a legitimate DeWalt part number, because it is only a partial of the other three. Hope that helps."

So they are definitely ready for production. I checked and my local Home Depot doesn't have them but the nearby Lowes does. They don't have any user reviews yet though. Amazon tends to overestimate delays rather than not meeting promises, and I can't think of why Dremel would send review samples unless it were planning to send them out very soon. If you have specific questions, you might want to wait until the reviews start coming in, or brave it and get one locally if a store has it. You can expect to see reviews coming in perhaps as early as next week, and almost definitely by the following week. I know it's been a while since you posted your question, so if you got one by now you may want to write your own review. If not, if there's something specific that you want tested, you could post here. I can't promise anything though but it would be nice to know how people plan to use it."

The 5-shelf unit (model 01558501, with ventilated shelves) is rated for 150 lbs per shelf. So the shelves of the 5-shelf unit are supposedly 3x as strong as the shelves that come with the 4-shelf unit.

By the way there is a big debate about the water source (its a river which have high level of heavy metals in the water) where I live but the Mayor doesn't listen to those people. So we bought this cause we tired of seeing orange water when we use hot water but it didn't solve that problem (I think the amount of iron and rust is way more than this filter can handle). But it solved the bad smell issue which might be chlorine and other odors in the water. Then we look for a shower head filter and I found something called \"Hi Home Magic Shower Head\". Now we are using these 2 filters and rust is gone the bad smell is gone works like a charm for us. But as I said our water was literally orange colored maybe that's why sprite didn't work without the other shower head filter. I hope that information helps."

        "answer": "When I first got the saw, yes there was a lot of side to side wobble. I pulled the plastic strips the saw runs on off and placed them as far apart as possible. The saw is now rock solid when it's on the rail. Another change I made was I cut out about 1\" of the spring that holds the saw in the up position. This still holds the saw up but drastically reduces the wrist fatigue when using the saw. It makes it much easier to hold down when reaching across a 4' wide sheet. (Check out https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vqqcmC5UY5E) After making these changes, I have absolutely no regrets in purchasing this saw. I'm much happier with it than a homemade edge guide and a standard circular saw. Hope this helps."

The new set is $109.00 and has a 2-year limited warranty, but you have to pay for shipping if ordered directly from CPO. On Amazon, search for Black & Decker LCC420 String Trimmer and Sweeper Lithium Ion Combo Kit, 20-volt. This is shown to be the newer model with the 20v Lithium battery. You will get 2 batteries and 1 charger. That set is new and has 2-day free shipping. $99.00 is a great deal seeing that just one of the batteries cost $40 to $50.00. I hope that helps."

You can also purchase a 1/4\" drill chuck that will take any size drill bit; this tool will then be limited only by what size drill the chuck can handle. I have drilled 1/2\" holes in wood with this driver but with anything larger, I wouldn't be using this driver anyway. I would switch over to a 120v electric drill. So, I guess it really boils down to what you plan to do with this driver. I use it for screws most all of the time but if I need to drill some holes it will do the job very nicely.

        "answer": "There are problems with doing this task beyond the wiring. You will be working on a ladder. You will be working poking your head through the fan blades to access the dome where the fan attaches to the ceiling. You will be twisting wires together and fastening them with wire nuts. You should disconnect the electricity supplying the fan. And finally, and possibly most difficult for a lady is you may need to lower and lift the weight of the assembled fan. If you can follow the wiring directions, that last item could be your biggest problem. If you still have the fan original installation instructions (or if you can find them online), study how the fan is mounted to the ceiling. If you need to lift the weight of the fan at any point, you might want to have this done. If the dome drops or snaps or unscrews off of the ceiling (and slides down the pipe holding the fan) then the task is SO much easier and I would say you could do it. If that is the case, ask at your hardware store how to use wire nuts to fasten stranded wire to solid wire and stranded wire to stranded wire and go for it."

Amazingly, my first unit had the batteries in it for 7, possibly 8 years. I simply never thought about it until my son asked me about the batteries when I gave him one. He's had his for 3 years now and he has not changed the batteries. My son also bought the other version with an on/off switch when he couldn't find the 2AC at the hardware store; it works fine too, though he generally uses the 2AC. Fluke mentions a low energy circuitry... whatever they designed, it works superbly and has identified countless hot circuits I presumed were hot. And saved me from a few hot circuits I thought were cold. The oldest unit I own is probably a dozen years old."

        "answer": "The only one I know about was an easy solid state construction project way back in the '90s. It had only a handful of components, including a triac, a silicone controlled rectifier (SCR), a potentiometer (variable resistor) and about 6 resistors and capacitors. It was in a book of simple electronic projects. I built it in an hour (once I had the parts). Unfortunately, I lent it to someone who tried to use it with a 5HP elevator motor. That slagged it. The other responder to your original question is WRONG. Any speed controller that reduced voltage, also reduces available torque. That'll work for a fan because the load is small & balanced. That isn't very desirable in a lathe motor as it will stall the machine if anything but the smallest cuts are attempted. The solid state controllers such as the one sold by Amazon interrupts the AC waveform to a greater or lesser extent, thereby allowing full torque at any speed (& smooth operation at even slow speeds). I'd Google \"solid state AC motor speed controller\", sift the hits for any mention of \"DC\" - which would rule it out for your application. Check out what's left for your motor (check with the seller as you did with Amazon). BTW, the reason your lathe has gears (or pulleys) to regulate speed is because, until Triacs, there was no other way to slow an AC motor & retain necessary torque. Good luck."

        "question": "Can I use this with a Black and Decker corded drill? Model DR350FD 6 amps with a \"removable chuck\"?",
        "answer": "Sure, any chuck will clamp on to it. I just went out to the garage and tried it. It works fine. There are six flats on the Milwaukee 90 degree unit and three moveable flats on the three-jaw chuck. It grips fine; no adapter needed. Clarification: the input shaft can be driven by a standard three jaw chuck from a cordless or corded drill driver. The output however, requires a 1/4-inch hex adapter to be able to grip a drill bit. The one I purchased is a Milwaukee 49-22-1560 1/4-Inch Chuck Attachment, cost $26 a little over a year ago. Hope this helps. Winds up being a little pricey, but sometimes it's the only way to get the job done."

This flexible linking cord is approximately 17 inches in length, with a 1 inch plastic linking connector on each end, for a total length of approximately 19 inches. The instruction flier says the following: \"Electrical cord can be routed around corners to suite the installation\", and it has a diagram showing both the electric cord (plug end), and a linking cord being routed around corners. The flier also says \"Link fixtures up to 18 inches apart\". So as long as you're not wanting one fixture to be more than 18 inches away from another (as measured traveling around the corner), you should be able to do what you want."

In my opinion the battery life is above average when using a quality, (not necessarily expensive) set of batteries. I buy all my batteries thru Amazon, including those I use in my insulin pump. Always buy name brand but they are still a fraction of the price of local sellers. AAA, AA, CR2032, LR44, etc. I use for optics and other things and at the price I get them on Amazon, I can buy enough to never worry about not having what I need at any time. I elaborate because a crappy battery will give short life in the best of devices. A decent or really good battery will give long, long life."

Unless you have cedar thicker than two inches and are making holes smaller than two you should be fine. However if that is your goal a Fostner bit would be more practical."

You need to take a pass one after the other to keep them even. You should be sure to adjust the fence to 1/2 the board's width so that you are able to be uniform in the passes. Ideally you should use a surface planer or large drum sander greater than the dimensions of the board you wish to plane"

        "answer": "JET Equipment was born in 1958 when the founder of the company, Leslie P. Sussman, took the first Boeing Jet Airplane trip from Seattle, WA to Japan. JET began as a small dealer of manual chain hoists and trolleys; sold from a single hardware store in Tacoma, Washington. Over the years, JET has carried everything from electric chain hoists, air hoists. Beginning in the 70's JET introduced a full line of industrial air tools and material handling products which included paving breakers and backfill tampers and forklifts. By the early '80s, as JET continued to grow, the metalworking products became the core business line. And 5 short years later, JET launched it's woodworking product category rounding out the largest breath of product categories under one brand. JET pioneered the import business by working with overseas suppliers. We are proud to say we still do business with one of our original suppliers. In the 90's JET grew from being just an importer of high quality machines and tools to designing and manufacturing its own products to stringent specifications. We are have an expert team of engineers both in the USA and overseas and a world-class supply chain ensuring prompt delivery of quality products. Over the years, our colors have changed from blue, to green, orange, and finally white that you see today on most of our products. Our product lines have grown, and the distribution centers have expanded; but one thing has remained the same. JET still carries the same message of quality product, with the best features and benefits in it's product class; all the while providing excellent service. We pride ourselves on bringing new products to our consumers and working with world class distributors."

        "answer": "Even though they appear to have a seam that looks like it would contain a hinge joint, neither the angle of the four sockets, nor their spacing are adjustable. The rectangular slot-like aspects on the side of each socket are the joining points between the plastic base of the sockets and their cylindrical extensions. This dovetail design provides more stability than other methods of joining two pieces of plastic together."

The paint remained on the wall, it did not peel off and the colour of the paint was not affected. The only thing I have noticed, sometimes a sticky substance is left on the wall after removing the decal; however, with dish soap, water and a little \"elbow grease\", the sticky substance comes off. This has only occurred when the decal was on the wall for an extended period of time (4 years). If you are just putting it up for a birthday party, you should be okay. :) I hope this helps.

It's a good, versatile thermostat that's easy to install with your installation manual, and easy to program. Took me about 5 minutes to install, and I've never installed one before."

A close friend found the same with his. After you have changed the batteries if it starts clicking, try turning it off for a few seconds and then on again, this may help.

        "answer": "Ditch the square, follow your line using the cut guide at the front of the base plate. You'll cut much straighter that way than you will watching the blade cut the line. The only time you should be watching the blade is when you start and finish the cut. A speed square is handy for getting that extra precise 90 degree cut, but there should be a point where you don't need it for most framing related cuts. If what you're doing requires an extra precise cut that will be seen, I don't see why you can't still use the square in your left hand, just let your waste fall to the right. You could also just get used to cutting with your opposite hand, it's good to be ambidextrous with a circular saw."

For small amounts like that, you can either just live with it or straighten it out. You can straighten by chucking up a rod and tapping with a hammer while watching a dial indicator (see YouTube for more details). The included chuck only goes down to 1/16\" I think. But you can get any number of specialty chucks. Jacobs brand chucks are pretty much the standard. FYI, you need a Morse 2 tapered arbor for this press."

What that length gets you is pretty fine control over the torque without bearing down hard. Also it goes pretty high for a 3/8\" drive so again you need some leverage to be able to drive those torques without resorting to force which may overshoot the target.

I use mostly substrates like underlayment and material that winds up more as dust then fibrous sawdust. I have read that other people have come up with alternative collection systems that involve a larger diameter shoot and you can find that advise online. I do agree the dust collection attachment could be a larger diameter. If it was, then that's one of the few things on this tool that could be an improvement. Happy researching."

I have used them when gluing tiny parts that can't be held in place easily. Remember to put the pieces together first and flow in the CA glue thin (fresh bottle is best). If any ends up on the outside for ceramics you can scrape away with a razor blade carefully (let it cure overnight) or use the solvent carefully making sure it doesn't get to the glue joint. For tiny things using a wooden tooth pick to carry the glue work well, just put a puddle on some tin foil and pick the liquid up with the pick and the crack will suck it in. Hope that helps."

There are also ones made of a variable voltage, and a selection of power plugs. If yours is not working, check both of the wires for continuity from the base of the transformer to the plug. It is common for a wire to break at the base of the plug in transformer, or the base of the plug. Usually can be fixed easily. The little wall wart power supply rarely burns out. So the power is still there, just not getting to the end of the plug. Harbor Freight gives away volt-ohm meters. Perfect for troubleshooting with."

It has more power than even most central vacuums. As a side note when you see a company giving its power rating in \"HP\" it usually means that they are hiding the power rating. HP ratings mean nothing and all standard ratings on vacuum cleaners should be done in CFM. Hope that helps :) Thanks Dustin GreatVacs (seller)"

        "answer": "I agree with the previous answer. If the shower filter has threads that match a standard shower outlet pipe, it should work. You should be aware, however, that the unit might not be as stable as it would be if connected directly to the wall outlet pipe. The connector that the shower head itself hooks to is on the piece that connects to the wall pipe and if your filter unit is not as stable as the wall outlet pipe then the shower head will reflect that in its installation. Good luck, I hope it works for you!"

This products turns the wood green to dark green, and no stain will look right if applied on top. I applied this product to some posts and then stained it, and you clearly can see where the CopperCoat ends close to the ground line."

Rubber bushing is easily removable and inserts back again snugly. If you required a shallower top height, you could easily sand it down and still maintain the integrity of the dog.

However, it should be placed in an adjoining room to save floor space, and minimize sound even more. I should tell you however, there is a type of compressor that is made specifically for your purpose. Although it usually cost much more, it is also even more quiet in operation. It is a compressor that is used for the Refrigeration industry as well, and you know how quiet your refrigerator is, right? I don't have a specific name or brand to suggest, but I know they are out there, if you look for them. Try looking for a Rotary type that may even be linked to dental equipment in Amazon's search engine. Now, if it were me, I would save the money and just put this Cal. Compressor in a closet, but you must decide for yourself. Good luck Sacha."

        "answer": "This does NOT come with an adapter plate since this is made for a single hole install. You can get any escutcheon to make the single hole design work where there are many counter top holes present. The one I used was \"8\" Kitchen Sink Faucet Hole Cover Deck Plate Escutcheon, Brushed Nickel\" found here: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005GLWFC4/ That install was for a kitchen sink that was to have light use however. Choose a look which is good for a pedestal sink. Most hardware and big box home improvement stores have escutcheons and such to allow changes like this (three or four hole settings taking a single hole faucet). Just be sure you seal everything, facet bottom and escutcheon, with plumber's putty or clear silicone as you may need to. The included lines are long enough to work with mounting this on top of an escutcheon and have no issues. If you are not doing this yourself, ask the plumber who you'll hire to do the job about his ideas and send him a link to the Amazon page. The normal install is just put this on the surface of the sink in a single hole. Any minor change, like an escutcheon or other small elevation for this to sit on, does not effect the working of the faucet however."

If that is the case, the water level will reach 12 to 14\" before activating pump. If you have a 10\" or greater diameter opening, you can mount the float switch, using a long zip tie, to the top of the pump casing (you can see bracket on top of float switch in picture), the pump will activate at approximately 4.5\" water level. You can slide the float switch further down, but the pump will run more often. The float will be below the drain tile. I have two of these used in conjunction with a 12v backup. They were purchased on Amazon and I am a satisfied with them. The float switches are mounted to the casing."

        "answer": "A one-inch hole would be plenty. If you would prefer a smaller hole, how about: 1) Clip the cable so that the sensor plate is no longer attached. 2) There are two wires in the cable; clip one of the two wires 1/4\" shorter than the other. 3) Strip off some insulation from each of the two wires. Be sure not to strip so much off the longer wire that the shorter wire can touch the longer wire's bare metal, and thus sound a false alarm. Once you've done that, you could probably shove the wire through a very tiny hole and it would still do a fine job of detecting water."

        "answer": "The color rendering index (CRI) of a light source is a quantitative measure of its ability to reproduce the colors of various objects faithfully in comparison with an ideal or natural light source. It is significant because it has been the most difficult metric for incandescent replacement light bulbs to match (while maintaining high efficiency) and therefore the most frequently ignored. For that reason, LED light bulbs with a high CRI can be worthy replacements for incandescent light bulbs. Most LED lights do not have a CRI above 90. However, CRI is a poor indicator of the perception of light produced by LEDs, and scores as low as 25 can produce vivid-appearing white light, while high-scoring sources can still be very poor at rendering reds, including skin tones.

        "answer": "Albert, the switch is a spring loaded button that goes in the door jam above the hinge, or on the closing side of a sliding door. The switch, in the natural position with the door open and plunger extended, will turn the light on. When you close the door, it will press the switch and disconnect the circuit. I will give you some heads-up advice - if you have a solid wood frame and are doing this as an addition to a swinging door, you will have to cut a large chunk out of the 2x4 frame so the switch will fit. I installed this on three closets. It's an awesome little device, but just prepared to tear in that corner of the door, make a little mess, and do some patch-up work. If you want the switch to turn the light on when the door is closed, rather than when the door is open, you will be better off buying the correct switch. There is no way to reverse the function of the switch."

        "answer": "These are indeed not suitable for driving as they almost fully block blue light! These are primarily protective glasses and they provide good \"physical\" protection against anything that can get into your eyes (e.g. in a lab or manufacturing area). The secondary 'property' of these specific pair with orange lens is to block blue light. In certain industrial environments continuous and/or high level of blue light is present which can cause damage to, or at least fatigue of the eyes. So, the blue blocking property helps to mitigate that for the workers. Now, most of the consumers here (me as well) are buying these for their blue blocking capability and not the physical protection. Generally, the blue (and green to some extent) light is one of the causes of eye fatigue for individuals who work in artificial light (e.g. fluorescent), and with computers (the monitor being the source); therefore, some people are getting the glasses for helping with that. Another interesting advantage of wearing these is for those people like me who have delayed sleep phase syndrome: it has been found that these individuals can benefit from reduced blue light, a few hours before sleep. By reducing the blue light with these glasses, the amount of disturbance to the sleep is reduced - at least it is working for me. - For reference on the protective property of the glasses please visit \"http://uvex.us/uploadedFiles/ProductConfiguration/ProductLiterature/skyperfamily.pdf\" - For reference on the lens tint property please visit \"http://www.uvex.us/uvexlenstechnology.aspx?id=4178\" - For delayed sleep phase syndrome and the effect of blue light please check: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder#Non-pharmacologic Cheers, hhsquall"

        "answer": "This power distribution box converts a 220V input feed with a neutral conductor into multiple 120V output circuits that are GFCI protected and over-current protected at 20 amps. If your generator can output 20A at 220V, then you can theoretically connect up to 40A of load at 120V via this distribution box as long as your 120V loads are balanced on a per phase basis. To ensure system safety, your generator output must have a 30A 2-pole circuit breaker (20A or 25A would also be fine) to ensure the per phase current never exceeds 30A, which is the rating of the twist-lock input receptacle."

If that is not possible use several petrifier treatments - letting each cure before applying another - maybe 3 treatments.) The stuff really does stiffen crumbling/rotting wood, but it is not a cure-all for wood that is completely decayed. If you are looking just to seal the butt-ends of pt lumber, I would consider something like Woodlife Coppercoat Green Wood Preservative ( chemically similar to the original pt but green in color, which gradually fades to clear - two coats) or Ace WoodRoyal Waterproofing and Protector/Toner for decks, etc. (comes in a number of semi-transparent toner colors (less toxic, but less durable - two coats).

Whether your bit is a twist or forstner, all measurements should be made at the cutting end of the bit. I use inexpensive calipers (Standard fraction units for fractional bits, Metric for metric bits)purchased at a hardware store. Hardware stores also sell a drill index for checking bit size. It's a flat piece of either steel of plastic with hole punched in it with corresponding size next to the hole. Hope this helps."

        "question": "Why are these 20V kits from Dewalt not available from Amazon directly and why are the prices from 3rd party so much more expensive? New line coming out?",
        "answer": "If you see a Dewalt drill on Amazon that Amazon says it is out-of-stock in their inventory, there may still be a third-party selling it. What's more, sometimes third party sellers team up with Amazon, so then the item will be held at an Amazon warehouse and will be shipped by Amazon. This is a partnership that allows for third-party companies to offer products through a trusted seller like Amazon, while still being actively involved in the actual sale of their items. In terms of pricing, we are unsure if there is a new Dewalt line coming out or not any time soon. It's very likely, however, but pricing in general - especially in used merchandise - is incredibly competitive. Competition sometimes forces extremes, with people vastly undercutting prices or vastly overpricing items to try to swing average prices in a certain direction. It's also possible that what appears to be a very high price was the average price not too long ago, but extreme undercutting dropped the average price artificially, and chances are the price average will eventually rise back up to where it should be. Thanks for your interest, and I hope this helped!"

The switch disconnects the battery so the light doesn't come on during shipment or handling. It arrives in the \"off\" position and you must turn it on after installation or it won't work. If the light were to remain on, the battery would discharge in an hour or two and the unit would turn off. The brief \"on\" time is to preserve the battery life so it will function most of the night. It will emit a glow (low power) as soon as it gets dark so you can actually see in the immediate area. It will brighten for about 30 seconds when the motion sensor activates it. The glow is about like a 10 watt bulb and the bright is about like a 60 watt bulb. Hope this helps."

        "answer": "Do NOT put a heater rated for 20 amps on a 15 amp circuit. It should trip the circuit breaker bc you are overloading the circuit. Better to call an electrician for a solution, which will probably include running a new 20 amp circuit, dedicated to the Panasonic FV-11VHL2. If you already have a heater in the bathroom, choose a Panasonic fan that doesn't include a heater, then you probably could use the 15 amp circuit, depending upon what else is served by that circuit."

        "question": "What is the beams distance on the highest output and is the beam focused or wide? I also would like to know when switching outputs does it go through each till i get to the desired output or does it switch to the output i want when needed",
        "answer": "The beam illuminates a 125 yard bard side extremely well. I rate well as being as good as nearly as good as daytime visibility. The beam it puts out is wide and non-adjustable. I would assume that it is non-adjustable to keep from having focus problems due to the bulb configuration. It cycles through the modes each time you depress the button, The way it cycles is Hold for 3 seconds(exits Lockout of it is turned on), 1 full push on/of, 1 half depression cycles through modes 3L, 150L, 600L, 1850L. With the flashlight off if you push and hold it will be on turbo mode (3800L). To lock turbo mode on you need to hold the button down and release half way and then repress the button, When in this mode you can half way depress the button and and change between 3800L and 1850L. For special modes the light can be on in any mode push the button all the way down twice quickly(a little tricky at first it needs to be quick). Then half depressions cycles between strobe, beacon and SOS. All special modes seem to us 3800 lumen. Pushing and holding the main button down for 3 seconds will enter Lockout mode. If left in standby mode the blue ring around the power button will flash. If you leave to standby or Lockout when turned back on it will go to the last mode you left it in. This makes it easy for finding the thing in the dark. Now to the OLED control button in any mode(except special modes) a push cycles through Head temp in C, #### lumens level ##, #.##V, Battery indicator, and Hours left at current level ###H. If the OLED goes out a push of the button will display the last displayed mode. If the light level is changed it will always revert back to Level screen. This flashlight does not have any type of auto level setting. On a final note it is a nice flashlight and I have tried its underwater function and also dropped it in oil(on accident) and it didn't hurt it any. Some oils will damage the optics of the glass so not really recommended I'm sure."

UL fire extinguisher ratings fall into two classes: Class A and Class B:C. A fire extinguisher typically carries both classes on its UL label. A UL rating may look like: 4A:60B:C. Class A refers to the amount of water the extinguisher is equivalent to; one \"A\" is equal to 1.25 gallons of water.

        "answer": "Yes. It operates on a simple principle, pressure from the desired direction passes through while pressure from the opposite direction is blocked and will often activate a release causing \"backflow\" water to be drained off. Note: If, for example, a hose is attached that has a nozzle at the opposite end, that is closed, then the hose will pressurize and retain its pressure. If the faucet (with the back flow device installed) is turned off, the pressure will remain in the hose until the nozzle is slightly opened (or a connection is loosened) then the internal valve will release the hose pressure through the relief 'vents' in the back flow preventer. This device meets building requirements in many localities where a back flow preventer is required on outdoor water faucets. I use mine with an RV, so that water from the RV side does not enter the city water source side of the valve."

        "answer": "Hi, I have not tried to hang a shelf but I have hung small cabinets with a cleat. I have a cabinet hanging on a cleat in my home. It has been hanging without problems for a couple of years now. The cabinet is about 20 inches wide, 30 inches high, and about a foot deep. The cleat is 18 inches wide and has about 6 anchor screws evenly spaced sunk into the wall. The difference with a shelf is that a shelf does not have sides and so the tendency to slant forward is very high and would happen with just a cleat and a board. If I were to do a shelf, I would put wood brackets on the sides so when the shelf is on the wall, it won't slant forward because those wood brackets will prevent that. I think doing it this way you can use the cleat but otherwise I wouldn't do it. Even using the side brackets the shelf with a cleat will stick out some from the wall, just a bit, because of the cleat thickness. That means you'd have to adjust the brackets somehow to level the shelf so it hangs properly. I hope this all makes sense to you. Good luck."

        "question": "Can it hold a 30\" french cleat to a heavy mirror Id like to hang. The mirror doesn't allow for screws. Wall cleat would be attached with proper screws",
        "answer": "I would say no. that cleat is meant to screw into the back panel of a frame of a mirror or picture. If there was more surface area on the part that goes on to the frame it would probably work but mirrors are generally heavy. I do not know what you are hanging exactly but if there is a frame you can look on the internet to see what you can find.if possible you could use this product to put on a back panel to make the whole back flat then use the cleat. there has to be a frame around the mirror or if you use the cleat and hang it the mirror will be angled down. If the entire back is flat and just the mirror alone there are 2 ways i can think of without seeing your mirror. 1 they sell sets of anchors you screw into the wall that secure it to the wall without putting screws in the mirror. 2 again if the mirror is flat you can put liquid nails on the back of the mirror and stick it on the wall. you may need to put something against the mirror so it will stay in 1 spot for 24 hours. If you do my 2nd suggestion you will not get the mirror off the wall without taking the wall with it."

        "question": "can the low heat temp be set below 55 degrees?",
        "answer": "Unfortunately not. They made a mistake and didn't even make it an \"installer\" option to lower it below 55. They try to give a technical argument that it prevents the possibility of condensation damaging the heat exchanger in your furnace. That is B.S., but even so, the user should have the ability to do it if that doesn't apply in their particular case. There is a work-around where you can intentionally un-calibrate the thermostat to actually be 48 degrees when it \"reads\" 55 on the display. However, this is not very practical if you have other people using the thermostat that are not aware of this intentional mis-calibration. My solution for the vacation home in Tahoe was to use the Honeywell Z-wave thermostat. They allow you to set it down to 40 degrees. It's not as well integrated with the Nexia system that I'm using, but I am able to remotely control it in the way I need. Good luck."

        "answer": "I would suggest that you read the Steibel Eltron literature to choose the unit (there is a sizing chart), and discuss the specifications with your plumber and electrician. A major consideration is the electrical service. You will need to plan on the electrical service installation to be done by an electrician. None of the units are just plug into the wall sort of thing. It is possible that your current panel may not handle the required service. the cost of the electric install and any upgrades needs to be considered. That said, we've had the Tempra 24 Plus in service for 3-years now and it is excellent meeting the needs for unlimited hot water at precise temperature for a 3-bedroom house. Do I want somebody to turn on the washing machine while I'm in the shower? No, but aside from that pressure drop and then lowered flow from opeing too many faucets at once, the hot water tempertures are maintained. Working well for us since we have variable inflow temperatures to the hot water heater since we run wood fired hot water based hydronic heating for the house. The input water temperature to the hot water heater ranges from 60-degrees to 112-degrees. The digitally controlled Tempra 24 Plus has three heating element chambers that kick on as needed to provide water at the temperature setting that we choose to set at 115. Very efficient even though it is electric since it only uses as much energy as need to reach the setpoint."

Now all you need to do is to pair the gateway with each of the EIMs individually. You press the Connect button on the EIM first, once the EIM green light starts to flash, press the bottom of the gateway, and the green RedLink light on the gateway will start flashing. Once that becomes solid, the pairing with that particular EIM is done. You can press the Connect button on the EIM now to exit the pairing mode of that EIM. You may then repeat this step for each of your EIMs until all are paired. At this point, you may connect your gateway to the internet router or switch, and its Internet light will start flashing, first in amber color, then in green. You should then proceed to set up the Honeywell account online to add the device (your gateway) and input the MAC ID and the MAC CRC when prompted. Once the device is accepted, the Internet flashing green light will turn solid green and you are all set. You should then see all your thermostats on your app."

You will also need the waste and overflow trim, but this finish does not match oil rubbed bronze drains. It is a more gold color than traditional oil rubbed or venetian bronze drains. Jaclo makes one that does match but it is not budget friendly. Consider using a white drain trim kit if your tub is white. If you are having a building inspection know that the rough in valve does not have stops on them. Stops are required by law in many counties across the country. Stops allow you to 5urn off water at the fixture and not at the main to your house. Lastly, do not use any cleaners on this finish. You will void the warranty and destroy the finish over time. Use only car wash or other mild products. If you would spray the cleaner directly on the hood of your car then you can use it on the tub shower trim."

With the R20 cans, you seem to be limited to about 65 watt floods these days (with standard or halogen lights), whereas with the R30 cans, you can get 75 or higher. If you want high-power lights, you might consider the Amico E27 Light Lamp Bulb Flexible Extension Adaptor Converter, which can hold any light bulb because it has no outer can at all.

The actual lamp bulb is about 10 inches long and has 12 light emitters positioned along inside of the bulb. I cannot read the wattage or the number of lumens on the bulb. Once the bulb is lit, there are at least 4 settings that are controlled by the remote to lower the lighting level of all of the emitters. The last setting is almost no light output at all. That's the best answer that I can give you. My piece of art is in a poorly lit hallway, and the lighting on the maximum setting and the next two settings is adequate to provide good lighting to the painting. I think that you will be satisfied. After all, I bet that you don't want a spot light on your art. If you do then you will probably have to hard-wire it."

I check mine about every 6 months, especially in early spring when most of my water starts to come in to the sump pump. All I do is unplug the main sump pump and wait to make sure the basepump kicks on. If there is no water coming into the sump, I have to run a garden hose into the sump to test it. The first year I had it, one of my tests failed because I must have not clamped the float down tight enough and the float got caught on the side of the sump wall and wouldn't raise but that was my fault for not tightening down the clamp enough. Thats why its always good to test any backup, no matter what it is."

        "answer": "I looked and measured. This can hold staples NO WIDER than 3/16ths inch. It can hold staples NO LONGER than 9/16ths inch. They are flat topped, not \"crowned\" --that is, the top of the staple is not for wire or cable, is is flat. The channel in which the staples travel is also flat. If you tried to use cable staples it would jam. You can use staples that are less than 9/16ths long, but they must remain 3/16ths wide. That size serves well for carpet and very, very light construction. I strongly discourage use of wider staples. Even 1/4 inch might be too tight. 1/2 inch wide is utterly out of the question. ---"

In my opinion, the second picture is of a homemade pair of goggles which are beautiful, but not useful for a product image because they aren't the actual product being sold. I think someone is showing off ones that they have built themselves, and while they are wonderful, they unfortunately don't have anything to do with the product advertised.

Don't be afraid if you see that most of your pavement is going away... is worth to clean well. For filling, this product will only help on less than 1\"cracks. For wider or potholes, you need to use patch ready mixes (like stone grade crack fillers) sold at Home Depot or Lowes and for medium size, a bulky crack filler material (i.e. Latex-ite Trowel Patch). I had to do it throughout the summer and let good time for drying. Most cracks re-appeared smaller and then, I had to filled them again. I finally covered with a high quality driver sealer and is so far, working good.

        "answer": "The total price is what should look at, each seller has different shipping models that they can use for shipping, either by weight of item/price of item/or simply \"free shipping\", but unable to have more than one shipping model used, so when a seller who is using the FREE SHIPPING model on their account and add item onto Amazon, if isnt enter correctly it won't reflect on their listing but affects weight or price shipping models depending on what is wrong in listing. So this is why price of item itself very low, to offset large cost of shipping. Once corrected the price of item will increase dramatically to reflect true price."

        "answer": "Not familiar with the ARD 11A perse, but that shouldn't matter as that is the garage door opener itself. The Pulsar Receiver is what receives the signal from the transmitter (the remote). So there are a couple things you need to know that I can't tell from your info. Pulsar makes several different receivers. The newer ones for Allistar door openers are called MVP (they have the logo right on the unit) if this is what you have it will be a learning unit (I,e, one that reads the code from your remote). They do not have dip switches there is a simple procedure to setting the remote up with a number and then pushing a button on the receiver to have it learn the code its transmitting. DIP switches come in several forms but in general are just a row of little manual switches (some with two positions up or down referred to as + or - usually, or three position up down or middle +.-,0) regardless these are switches that you set in a pattern of your choice on both the receiver and the remote so they are coded the same and the receiver will recognize the remote. The newer learning units do not use these. This remote does not have dip switches but can work with a DIP switch type receiver if you set the DIP switches in the receiver first then follow the programing steps with this remote. None of this matters if you receiver is not one that is operating on 318 Mghz which this remote uses. That is the primary question if they don't work on the same \"wavelength\" they can't talk to each other. The Pulsar unit should day on it somewhere on the back what frequency it is. I do think that 318 is typical for allistar but not certain. Worst case is you have to get this remote and buy a new MVP receiver as well. Hope this helps."

I used a 200 foot rope that I already had in order to pull my boat into the garage. I anchored the hoist to a back wall stud and pull the boat in by hand so I can place it in the garage all the way back to the wall. I could not see around the boat to back it in with the truck. It works really good, pulls the boat in with ease and I can feel when it just touches the back wall. Could not do it with the truck, I would end up damaging the boat or the garage. If you need a longer reach than the 10 or so feet get a longer rope. Hope this helps."

Where ever you decide to put the lamp, 25watts will be plenty. I have two in my bedroom. But in the other one I have a 15watt bulb. I hope I helped you out a little bit. :)"

Although I am a lawyer, I cannot answer that legal question, as I am not aware to which jurisdiction you are referring, nor am I aware of the specifications of this item. I was not looking for the answer to that question when we purchased nor installed it. I can say, however, this is an extremely high quality fixture, primarily stainless steel and brass, and on the nurse side (my other profession) where I do also focus on natural and holistic ideals, I do not recall seeing any lead parts nor any parts which would have made me suspicious of any lead content. Further, my husband who installed it, who owns rentals and is in real estate, and deals directly with plumbing all the time, would also have noticed if something appeared to have lead content. I remain convinced this is a great item, and am very pleased we have it."

If there isn't a visible nail jammed then there is a problem with the steel \"hammer\" that goes up and down to shoot each nail off of the \"stack\" you load. If you pull the cover back as if you were loading new nails you'll see all the way to the front where each nail is supposed to go down into the point and eventually the wood a \"stainless steel\" flat piece. This \"stainless or silver\" steel piece was what stopped the nail gun shooting in my case...it failed with the CPO reconditioned model and I had to take it to a Bostitch authorized repair shop to get it replaced. In the meanwhile I purchased a new one and never had the problem. Its frustrating but its nothing they said I could fix and Bostitch probably overlooked when they were \"reconditioning\" the nail gun. Good luck!"

        "answer": "I'll try and break the tie. Its an electric fan mounted in a heavy aluminum base (I dont think the pictures do them justice, these things are pretty big) that requires sunlight to shine on one side in order to work. IMO it doesnt really make any more noise than any other fan that moves a similar amount of air, my fridge is way louder. You would wind up with a 12\" or so circular hole in the roof that the fan is fastened to the outside of; you would need to put some sort of grill over the inside of it to keep fingers out of the spinning blades. It probably would not amputate a finger but could easily make a nasty cut. Plus its not the prettiest thing on earth to look at. You will also need a substantial source of air into the room otherwise you will be creating a suction. If the two rooms are connected you could swap the wires on the motor of one of them (would require some electronics skilz) and have one suck and the other blow and get a draft through the area. You will also need to provide a way to close it off completely in winter to avoid letting cold in. You could put a switch on it in conjunction with the closing mechanism so it doesnt run when closed. Additionally roof vents (powered or not) are not as insect proof as window screens, the openings are bigger. Might be a consideration for inhabited areas."

        "answer": "Yes it has two batteries. The -21 or -22 sets should include two 4.0Ah batteries. If not than don't get it. I have this same set. Had for almost two years and it's darn good. Awesome tool that surprises me every time i use. I drilled through a 4x4 with ease. Hot knife through butter. Impact driver has plenty of power too. Batteries charge fast. I have yet to use a full 4.0Ah battery load. Just never needed it. Plenty of power and a really great electronic battery control system that protects the battery and the tool. Others couldn't make that claim when i bought mine. You can Compare milwaukee tools and read up on the specifications at http://www.milwaukeetool.com/compare-products?skus=2691-22&skus=2697-22 A 5.0Ah battery is planned to be released very soon. For home use only the 3.0Ah battery is more than enough. I would suggest that you compare prices before you buy. Some times you can get great deals here and some times you get great deals on Ebay. Sometimes buying the parts individually can be cheaper. The price you list is a great price but check anyhow. It ain't going away soon - you got time to check. Milwaukee Tools are (typically) Guaranteed for 5 years. Milwaukee batteries vary, 3.0Ah 2 yrs warranty and the 4.0Ah is 3 yrs. Register your tools at https://www1.milwaukeetool.com/HeavyDutyClub/Join.aspx you can have a safe place to store and recall you tool information to provide the insurance company or the police or for your own records in case you need it. Milwaukee will stand by their tools. They have for years. I've used Milwaukee in industrial applications for decades and they never ever let me down. Since you have two batteries Might want to consider the Fuyel version for impact wrenches too. Beats the heck out running air hoses and air compressor worries. But you need to be the judge for yourself what you'll accept. I have the 2763 and the Fuel saw. They work! The Fuel model is typically more expensive by almost up to $100 more. Unless you can get a really great deal on a \"new set\" priced within $75 of the non-fuel or you DON'T plan to use it everyday for work \"i would not recommend buying the fuel version\". Price and Use are the only real Driving Differences between the two types for the homeowner experience. Everyday Work -- Get The Fuel Version - You wont regret it. The drill driver with hammer function is the only drill driver i would recommend, Fuel or Non-Fuel versions - get the Hammer Drill Type! Never know when you'll need it and it isn't that much more. The Fuel drill Driver is lighter, stronger and the motor vent is on the sides of the back handle verses the non-fuel model which has the vents out the back of the handle so if you press on the back of the handle while drilling you could block the motor vent and damage the motor over time. Sure hope this helps."

(i.e. it would be harder to move it because you'd have to lift it up out of the indentations. You would never be able to slide it out...) I have my elliptical on the same type of foam - just not as pretty as the wood colored mats - and its not that noticeable - unless you want to move the item at a later date... once indented to that degree over time - I dont think it will ever float back up. I use the pretty wood colored mats in my main room - so I can hang out on the floor an be comfortable. They're great!"

These work because most door hinges have kind of a self closer the last few degrees of closing and the blumation unit acts as a slow close shock absorber."

To flip the platform out of the way again, you just step up the next rung again and use your foot to flip the platform out of the way again. This allows you to step right past the platform on the way down. There's a vg video on this at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQtR9BVjV0"

I used a large screwdriver between the cover and the wall, up near the top where the tab is/was, and pried it away from the wall. The cover just pops off, and I've left it off. Now that the construction on our house is done and the workers don't need to get in so often, I've changed the code and am considering putting the cover back on. (It simply snaps on.) But that means that whenever someone has to use the code, they'll have to pry the cover off again, perhaps with a car key. A bit of a design fault, I think."

I have sprayed it over THIN washes of acrylic artists' paint on canvas and other materials. I have had problems with spraying this over over acrylic clear sprays, like Krylon Crystal Clear. Sometimes the paint surface buckles. I have sprayed it over DRY gold and metal leaf with good results. It also seems to work over DRY gold size, a type of varnish. I have also tried it on fiberglass furniture with high gloss finishes. Sometimes it will not take on this type of surface. I have also sprayed it on small pieces of metal jewelry (but usually prefer not to do this). Hope this helps. You should probably experiment in scraps of different types of plastic."

My problem with this item was because I think the back metal was touching the internal wires by accident. If the splitter serves no other purpose for you, you could try doing the same (get to the insides) to see if this is the problem, or there is something else wrong inside the unit. If all the cables work without the splitter, then it does sound like it is the splitter somehow, but there is no real guarantee that a different online product will be more successful. Might try a store where you can get a return maybe? Also note that a splitter is not the same as a switch. A splitter sends the same cable data to multiple units while a switch selectively merges different cables into 1."

        "answer": "Barry if you use the water I don't see any problem. I have done about 60 SF of counter top and about 30 LF of 4\" edge. From the appearance and feel of the pads they should easily do another job probably several more. I started out using the cup wheel to aggressivly get down to the aggregate - after doing about half of the top I started using the 50 grit pad as it is easier to control the depth and not nearly as aggressive. I have some pictures of each stage if you are interested. A word of caution - depending on how you plan to seal and finish your tops I would caution you about going beyond the 200 grit. Remember you MUST seal concrete or it will stain badly with spills - grease etc. I'm using a water based acrylic sealer which can be applied even after 800 - 1000 grit polishing. If you haven't already poured your tops make sure you use a good concrete mix. I used the big box 4000 PSI mix and added about 12 % portland type II cement to each bag. That gives you a denser concrete that is easier to finish and slightly more impervious top. I'll gladly answer any additional questions."

Some LED lights will last 20,000 - 30,000 hours. At an average of 3 hr/day that works out to about 27 years. I'm sure the motor or something else will fail before the light. I do really like the fan/light. I also purchased the wall remote, which is nice too."

        "answer": "Chris, you might want to ask your question directly to Kohler via their website. They were very helpful with questions I had before purchasing this faucet. I'm not sure if there is a water filter for this model. The end piece is the pull down spray arm and spray control buttons. Any attachment would have to go above that I would think and might interfere with the hose. Sorry I could not help you. By the way, I did a huge amount of research before purchasing this faucet, and I love mine. When you first turn off the water, there may be a few drips but it is most likely accumulated water in the end of the spout. Just press the button to release residual water or wipe its \"nose\" with a paper towel (sorry, that's the best way I can describe the drip). If it is annoying, Kohler will send you a fix as apparently this was an issue in the past."

A method to test is to tape down a 3 x 3 piece of plastic tarpaulin for two days and then check it to see if there is moisture gathered on the underside of the plastic. If moisture is present, consider some other form of coating."

I have seen some that are 76\" in height. Vertical slats can be removed to reduce overall maximum width. Hope this helps some.

If the only source of power you get is through a cable wire, not regular wall outlet, then you can't do that. Basically, you can only plug a normal wall plug into BOB.

That is very important. I used the primer also because I use seam tape to seal all seams and patches as well as going around the vents on their seams. I used 2 rolls of seam tape and about 2 1/2 gallons of primer. Than used about 3 gallons of Mobile coat on a 30 foot camper. Its good to have extra though.

Even Portland cement, which is finer may not penetrate well enough, though you might try that, hoping to preserve to some degree the appearance of your sink. But if looks aren,t too important perhaps clear liquid epoxy would seal better, or even a liquid super glue. Also, I suppose that you could later scour the \"glaze\" of glue off of the surface with scouring powder and elbow grease. The method would be to use as little glue as possible,yet to try to \"rub\" it into the crack."

        "question": "minimum cfm requirements",
        "answer": "Here is the answer from the Paslode site. As you will see, it depends upon the number of nails driven per minute. The F350S is a stick nailer not a coil nailer, so the nail magazine must be reloaded about every 75 nails. If you were nailing off flooring or decking, the rate of fire would be much higher than just building walls where the gun must be moved to a new joint location. 13. What size air compressor do I need? You can use the following formula to figure out the size air compressor you need. The Number of Tools being used X the Number of Nails each tool will drive per minute X 1.2 X the Amount of Air per Shot (SCFM) at the operating pressure. This number is found on the chart in the tool schematic and parts list provided with the nailer. For example, if you have two F-350S tools each driving 20 nails per minute with the compressor set at 90 PSI you get: 2 X 20 X 1.2 X .082 = 3.95. The compressor needs to deliver 3.95 CFM at 90 PSI. If you operate the tool at 120 PSI at the same rate the number will be higher: 2 X 20 X 1.2 X .108 = 5.2 CFM. When selecting an air compressor be aware that as the air pressure (PSI) increases, the delivery rate (CFM) goes down. Most compressors will rate the CFM at 50 PSI and at 100 PSI."

        "answer": "One reason these might stick is due to excessive heat. Make sure the bulb and fixture is all the way cooled down before you wrestle with it. Expect to have to give it a good twist for it to release, the heat can almost weld it into place. Since the bulb is dead, don't worry about touching the glass. But don't touch the glass on new bulbs! Because they get super hot, any amount of oil from your fingers will kill them within a short amount of use. Also, there are 2 different kinds of these bulbs, one kind twist locks in and another just plugs straight in. If you push the twist lock bulbs into the plugs they will jam. You can work them loose with jiggling or crush the glass with pliers and pull out the pieces. It's not elegant but it's the only way to free the prongs. Hope this helps."

        "answer": "The installation of the unit uses two adjacent breaker positions. Because of the design of breaker panels, two adjacent breaker slots places the surge protector across both of the utility poles of a two phase system which most homes have. Any incoming surge on any circuit in the panel will be \"seen\" by the protector since they are all connected to it, so therefore it works for surges in the entire home. Keep in mind however that surges can be generated from within the home and therefore sensitive electronics may also need to be protected by additional surge suppression equipment. Internally generated surges can wreak havoc on equipment before the surge reaches the Levitron system but external surges will be suppressed within the limits of the unit, before entering the house."

So in theory, the sticker should detect this radiation, but in my opinion the sticker is not a good choice for use against radiation from radon gas since most of the radiation is released in the lungs and may not be detected by the sticker which is outside of the body. My source is Wikipedia, so consider this information to be \"opinion\" only."

I've made 5 crosscut sleds with these and didn't own a self centering bit. Try clamping a good straight edge to the fixture bar when you tighten the screws down. Also if you are unsure of this or the incra ones, I prefer these. Hope this helps!"

The backer pad that comes stock with the unit is very stiff and quite flat...great for table tops, cabinet sides, planks, etc., but not for the multi-level surfaces of cars. Additionally this sander is a 6 hole vacuum unit and placing a polishing bonnet over the intake might cause the sander to overheat. Lastly the oscillation size is extremely small, great for sanding and \"polishing\" wood, but it might just end up burning the wax on the surface of the paint. So, I wouldn't recommend it.

        "answer": "I don't know why their customer service told Buck that info. In his review, he described the correct way to reverse it so that it does work for reverse-threaded applications. Reversing the head is the proper way to adjust the wrench to torque left-handed threads. The torque mechanism only works in one direction - clockwise is the default direction. Some wrenches have a push-through drive to get bi-directional torquing, but this one has a reversible head (some wrenches can't be reversed at all). It's not a big deal to reverse it. Doing so essentially \"turns the wrench around\" so that it will torque in a counter-clockwise direction. A \"reversible ratchet head\" feature is not the same as a \"reversible ratchet\" feature, and their product features clearly state it has a reversible head. Simply reversing the ratchet mechanism with the toggle only allows you to ratchet in both directions - it does not provide for torquing in the reverse direction."

However, there is enough room to swap out the hooks for larger ones. the eye of the hook is pinned with a bolt. Remove the bolt and go a size up. The existing hook eye has about 1/8\" clearance one each side of it with the bolt in place. so, you should be able to go up a size or maybe 2. ... or just use a 15/16\" rod and shoot a smaller elk (deer, bear, rabbit, whatever).

The amount of iron filings is dependent upon the size of the blade, how dull it was, and the number of blades you sharpen in any given setting. However, the filings are very small and fine so not very noticeable if you're only sharpening one blade. Let me know if you have any other questions."

A friend of mine touched a metal piece of furniture behind our shop vac, and got a nice small shock - and that was in Austin, which is not too dry. My experience with static electricity is that it is worst in dry and cold places, wintertime being it. Alas, in theory there should be a way to ground, but I have little experience, let me see... Aha, searching the internet for shop vac static discharge there are several suggestions - I am not allowed to post links here, so you'll have to search by yourself."

It is operated by pressure differential rather than current sensing, it is all metal construction so even if the gas exhaust is hotter it should be OK. The directions say it should be a least 15 feet of duct length away from the dryer anyway. I guess it might draw hotter air into the duct but you should make sure the ducts are well cleaned out when you install it. I'm very satisfied the dryer works faster, runs quieter and we do not get lint accumulating around the duct connection at the back of the machine. You might also check with your dryer manufacturer in case they have any concerns."

        "answer": "This unit probably detects CO at less than 30 ppm, but is not allowed to display that level unless a button is pushed. In this case, the peak level the alarm detected since last reset is what will show, not the current ambient level. From 30 to 70 ppm, the display can show the ambient level, but the alarm will not sound until it's been in that range for 30 days, as mentioned. At 70 ppm, the alarm is not to sound for at least an hour, and no more than 4 hours. That's UL requirements, which most codes across the US adhere to."

Most of these motors will mount up okay, but they differ in rotation speed, output shaft size, rotation direction (this is easily reversed, though), output torque, constant -vs- intermittent duty...

You will need to unplug your existing mig torch from the welder, the new spool gun cable will plug right in. You will have to cut off the plug that comes on the longevity. I cant remember if it is a 3 pin or a 4 pin plug. You will need to hook these wires inside under the hood where the existing wire feed motor is located. I hooked jumper wires inside and ran them to the outside and installed but connectors on these wires and also the wires that the 3 or 4 pin connector was attached to. You will have to connect 2 wires for the spool gun motor and a wire for your continuity. This is enough for now, I will look tomorrow at mine and make sure, lots of luck."

        "answer": "Hello Alan, I am afraid you cannot use Black & Decker BDPH400's (power unit) compressor with any other type of 3rd party spray guns. The reason being, the (power unit) compressor and the supplied gun are designed to work only with one another. If you've notice, the hose size on the 'HomeRight C800863' spray gun is comparatively smaller to the one of the Black and Decker gun. If you can find a reducer attachment for the Black and Decker power unit (compressor) to match the hose size of the 'HomeRight C800863' spray gun, then it might work. There's no guarantee though that it will. I haven't tried painting ceilings with this product yet; hence, I am unsure about your second question. I hope this helps!"

As an electronics technologist of long standing, I normally would not run any controlling device at any more than 80% of it's maximum load and would prefer to use only 60% of load maximum for long life.

        "question": "How do I prove to a TSA agent that this is approved for carry-on? There's no logo or info on that topic on the Wallet Ninja itself.",
        "answer": "A message from the manufacturer: While flying with our tools it is important to stay informed&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;. Though TSA does not provide an official approval certificate on any of its items, the only thing we can ensure is that our tools will fit inside of their guidelines. Most TSA Agents are uninformed themselves and will use a conservative approach&#8203; when dealing with an unknown situation. It's a lot easier for them to say something is prohibited and move on than doing their due diligence. &#8203;According to the official TSA website (http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/prohibited-items)&#8203; Scissors - metal with pointed tips and blades shorter than 4 inches are allowed, but blades longer than 4 inches are prohibited NO OK Our tools meet the guidelines because 1. There are no actual \"blades\" or sharp edges, the entire unit is rounded off with soft corners 2. The entire tool isn't longer than 4 inches. Metal with pointed tips shorter than 4 inches is very much permitted. These 2 points alone should be enough to make your case. Remember, TSA Agents don't have these rules memorized, so it is important that you do!"

        "answer": "Ha Ha...that's the way it's SUPPOSED to be, but I found that the set I ordered worked just the opposite way. You can put one of them in place and see if it will trip on or off; I think you'll find that the red turns on and the green turns off. Also, they're visually a tad different, so once you figure out which is which, you'll be able to just \"eyeball\" them to distinguish them. Apparently, this mistake arises because different timers are engineered differently. This was a minor \"head scratcher\", at first. But with a little old-fashioned observation, investigation, and experimentation, it solves easily enough. Good luck!"

        "answer": "It really depends on what you want to plug the strips into but two choices that I bought to use to get the four wires out to use the three colors of leds are \"HitLights LED PCB RGB LED Strip Any Angel Turn Connector, 4 Conductor, For SMD5050 or SMD 3528 RGB Color Changing LED Strip, Strip to Strip, 4 pcs \" and \"HitLights LED PCB Connector Box For 5050 SMD RGB Color Changing LED strip, Strip to Strip, 10 pcs \" or you can just solder wires direct to the pads on the cut lines of the strips. And yes the driver itself would need to be cabable of dimming the leds or if you are simply are going to feed them with 12Volts then you can but a simple dimmer switch in-line with the common feed and dim the leds that way with no driver at all. I personally bought a controller from Custom Dynamics to make my LED strips strobe, dim, and change colors."

        "answer": "You have to have completed the product registration and connected equipment Registration sections of the Surge Protector Registration card, signed it, and mailed it back to Globe Electric within 30 days of purchasing the surge protector. If you have not done that, there is no coverage under the limited lifetime warranty. If you have done that, then the surge protector light on the unit must not be showing \"protected\" anymore if a surge has truly occurred. If it has occurred and someone continues to use the surge protector anyway, the warranty is void. Finally, you have to submit a claim under the warranty within 15 days from when the surge occurred by sending them a copy or the original receipt for the surge protector purchase and a brief, written description of how the damage occurred. If no original receipt for purchase of this unit can be sent with claim, it will not be covered. Per the warranty, you can call their customer service (1-800-361-6761) to receive a Return Authorization number to send the surge protector back. That's just for making a claim for the surge protector. For any equipment connected to it, you must do all the above PLUS provide original purchase receipt for the damaged item, plus you must have made a claim for the damage to this item with whomever your power company is FIRST that they have denied to you IN WRITING, then you must have also made a claim through the product manufacturer SECOND that they have denied to you IN WRITING, and have also filed a claim through your homeowners or property insurance which they have denied to you IN WRITING. These actions must be completed when making a claim through them within 6 months of them issuing you a Return Authorization number. Then, they require the manufacturer of the damaged item or one of their authorized service providers to assess the damage and provide a written repair estimate & technical assessment, both of which needs to be sent to Globe within 6 months of you making the claim. Personally, if it was me, and I wanted quick resolution - I would just claim it through my homeowners/property insurance company, pay my deductible and be done with it."

Hard part: If your polisher has its anchor above the surface of the pad, i.e., you can see a screw holding it onto your spindle, then NO, it will not fit. This item is designed for orbital action that uses a \"soft center\", i.e., the cushioned material covers the entire pad surface. If this describes yours, it attaches underneath the dust skirt and requires a very thin-profile wrench (which should have come with your polisher.) Hope that helps. . ."

The only possible downside is the water being too soft (low electrical conductivity/minerals), which I add trace minerals to my water after distilling for balance and to re-ionize the water and make it less soft."

I bought the the HEPA version just about 6 months ago and it was $368, so it was definitely cheaper to buy the HEPA version outright instead of the HEPA accessory package and the vacuum separarely. Now it seems it's $100 cheaper to to buy the vacuum and HEPA kit separately. Don't forget you also need to buy the foam filter to use this as a wet vac, it is not included and don't think of using this to vacuum joint compound dust without the HEPA kit or you'll kill it. It is an amazing quiet powerful vacuum, just irritating you have to buy everything separately."

        "answer": "As Krylon Fusion is advertised as \"Bonds to Plastic\" and \"The no-prep, superbond paint for Plastic\", I'd guess that it should work well on 'plastic drums' used for outdoor garden planters. I used Krylon Fusion to paint Trangia (polythene) fuel bottles (originally red) with green Fusion paint, even after online research told me \"paint would not stick to polythene.\" I wanted to visually distinguish 'alcohol fuel bottles' from 'coleman fuel bottles'. Due to the polythene material, I allowed a longer (overnight) drying time, and applied two coats. I've been very pleased and impressed with the results, and the paint seems to be fairly resistant to fuel that spills onto the paint. I don't know your plastic drum composition, but I'd guess Krylon Fusion should work pretty well for your use and outdoor environment."

If you were to take care and position the straps under the heaviest part, I think that it would work well for you. One of the best things about the straps is that you can avoid awkward lifting positions.

If you increase the flow rate above 0.5 Deg. F the temperature rise will decrease below 90 Deg. F. I have discovered that if I am using only the hot water and decrease the flow rate the temperature goes up. Note: 1 BUT will raise 1 pound of water 1 Deg. F; 1 gal = 8.34 pounds of water.

It seemed it fell because the plastic fractured which caused the unit to fall. Each shelf was holding roughly 30lbs or less stressing less. They had aerosol cans on them."

Leave it on the charger long enough to get a charge also. I think offhand it is about 2-3 hours to charge, but I usually leave it on the charger for a day or two. They are ni-cad batteries, and can and will develop a memory if not discharged completely. It made all the difference in the world to have the new battery.

However, personally I used to use aluminum oxide sand paper on a 3/8\" piece of glass to sharpen chisles, plane irons, gouges, etc. finishing at about 320 grit. To me it was good enough for bench chisels and carving tools. At 1000 grit, the diamond stone is way better and it cuts in a fraction of the time. I tend to want to be practical at the quality of a cutting edge and not at the expense of time. I can sharpen a bench chisel in about 5 minutes with the diamond stone. I can't come close to that with water stones. They are too slow for me."

The mural is beautiful and we are very happy with it. However, any exposure to rain or water of any kind would ruin the mural. The glue is water soluble. For example - when we were installing the mural some of the color came off with just a few wipes of a damp cloth...maybe it was because the material was wet from the installation process. Also, if the exterior wall of your adobe has a very rough texture I think it may be difficult to install the mural without tearing it."

It was otherwise in good shape to I gave it to a buddy that didn't have one and said to send it to Dremel for repair and he would have a refurbished unit for cheap. He took my advice and sent it in for repair. Dremel did the work under warranty and sent the tool back to him no charge.

I then replaced just one of the bulbs with a conventional incandescent bulb and it worked fine. My guess is that there is a minimum load level that has to be there for it to work properly. A 15w load was apparently too small, but when I added a 25w incandescent bulb that increased the load, it worked fine. So if you have a load over 15 watts, it should work with dimmable LED bulbs. As for compact fluorescents, I have no experience there. I do know that the bulbs would have to be specifically labeled \"dimmable\" for you to even have a chance for it to work. I suspect that you'd still need a load greater than 15w like what I had to create with the LED bulbs. Hope this helps..."

        "answer": "Its recommended installation on copper piping. However the package says either plastic or copper. Others have reviewed installing on plastic just make sure u pre drill the hole with a slightly smaller drill bit than the punture pin. I also have plastic piping but went to copper near the water heater so I ended up installing mine there. Just to be safe. If u go ahead on the plastic there is rubber housing around the puncture pin area to help prevent leaks. Its really easy to install. If anything u can check utube for installation instructions but highly doubt u will need. Theres lots of step by step videos there."

But the EA8W is better in foggy or rainy conditions because it does not cause as much light to be reflected back at the user, therefore providing better visibility under those conditions. And the EA8W provides (for many people) a more accurate color rendering, much like sunlight, while the EA8 is a brighter but colder light and tends (for many people) to cause colors to \"wash out\" a bit. I personally have the EA4 (4xAA), which is the \"little brother\" of the EA8, and so far I have not missed having the EA4W (neutral white) version."

You have to firmly grasp the globe and wiggle it downward, ensuring you hang on to the thing positively, so you don't drop it. For someone a bit fearful, this might be a two person job, one to grasp the fan housing and hold it steady, the other to pull firmly on the globe and wriggle it free. If you do it once, you'll never forget! I put a flourescent candleabra bulb (it had a double base on it, the wide and the small--and my fan takes the small) and screwed that firmly into the fixture. I was 'just' able to fit the globe back on. It's probably the only thing that doesn't thrill me about this fan--otherwise, I like it."

To better adapt to the changing world of light bulb technology, this control system features a CFL Auto-Detect feature that prohibits light dimming if non-dimming CFL bulbs are used in the fan. It also is our first control that eliminates dip switches and frequency interference through the use of Learning Code Synchronization. Similar to garage door programming, the fan and control are paired together when installed with a unique pairing code automatically. To increase flexibility, this control system can be used in Indoor to Damp location environments."

        "answer": "If your hear it or not depends on where you can locate the sensor unit in proximity to your bedroom. It is not super loud so it probably wake you up if you can get the sensor close enough to your bedroom to still pick up his movement if he get up to leave his room. You might consider using a drive way alert instead...it is a little louder and you can put the sensor so it beams across his bedroom door and the main unit in your bedroom next to your bed since it is wireless."

        "answer": "Not marked on Kit, but found this elsewhere: Most DeWalt power tools are now assembled in Mexico, China, or Taiwan from components manufactured in Mexico, China, Taiwan, the Czech Republic, Brazil, Korea, Japan, Thailand, or the USA. Before 1984, DeWalt power tools were manufactured in Canada, the USA, and the UK. In 1984, DeWalt's parent company acquired the woodworking and power tool assets of the German manufacturer ELU. After that acquisition, DeWalt routers and a few of their other power tools were manufactured at former ELU factories in Germany, Italy and Switzerland. Starting in roughly 2000, DeWalt gradually moved most of their power tool assembly plants to Mexico, China, and Taiwan. In April 2011, Stanley Black & Decker (DeWalt's current parent company) launched a line of hand tools under the DeWalt brand. Most of these hand tools are manufactured in China, Mexico, Taiwan or Thailand. A few hand tools (such as their retractable knife, tape measures and screwdrivers) are assembled in the USA from globally-sourced parts. As of January 2013, a few DeWalt power tools are still manufactured in Europe. The DWS520 track saw and certain compact SDS rotary hammers (e.g., D25313) are manufactured in the Czech Republic. The 3 HP DW625 plunge router is still manufactured in Italy."

        "answer": "You comparing apples to oranges. The M22 Warrior, is not set up for recharging although it can be with removable batteries. The M22 has a very deep dish smooth reflector with slightly larger dia that beats the R40 in throw. The M22 is set up with tail switch and grip ring for \"cigar grip\" in handgun shooting. The M22 has more aggressive crenellations that are blackened stainless steel. The M22 head is designed with the most heat sink grooves of any flashlight I've ever seen. They get hot! The R40 must be new and Olight web site is down at the moment. Also you should know that the top lumen rating is only for like the first 6 min of use. The lumens are close enough it wont make a diff. Make your choice based on the features you need. I personally don't care for side buttons."

It's hard to tell from the picture, but the darker section from which the motor's shaft protrudes is actually a cylindrical gear box, and it is geared to give mechanical advantage to the motor behind it. You would have to spin the shaft with so much force that the power you got out of it would probably not be worth it. What you want is setup where that gear arrangement was reversed. Then a very little input would result in a productive output."

        "answer": "It depends on where you plan to position yor faucet with the bowl and what you find aesthetically pleasing. Personally, I would say 19\" x 19\" would be a minimum. It would allow for a bit of additional space around the edges, and you could position a faucet coming out of the wall instead of the vanity. Or if you want the faucet coming out of the vanity itself, allow additional room for that space. Of course, you could go bigger or smaller than this--bigger if you require space for toiletries; smaller if you are good with a \"pedestal\" look with the vanity smaller than the bowl radius. Keep in mind you need to account for the space needed for plumbing underneath, which will vary. Some people like the look of exposed plumbing, in which case the vanity will not need to be large enough to encase it. Others will want all of that covered. Your personal preferences will come into play with all of this. One thing to keep in mind is that this is a beautiful, substantial bowl, so even if you have a small vanity, it will have sculptural appeal. Hope that helps."

I use it mostly in my carburetor restoration business to resurface aluminum, bronze, pot metal and cast iron castings, so I graduate the belts that I use from 100 to 150 to 180 grit for a smooth finish. I also use the 180 grit alone to finish the ends on small-diameter brass tubing and round stock. Jeff"

If they're on with superglue, you might have more difficulty removing them and it might leave residue on the plastic cap.

        "answer": "yes, one bag is plenty for this unit. You have to screw the meter/top off the top of the tank; it just screws/twists off like any bolt or cap. Then take out the long tube from the tank. The old resin will be kind of mushy and slimy mixed with water. I just dumped it into plastic bag that I had cut some small holes in the bottom to let the water out and the old resin stayed in the bag. Then rinse out the tank till its clean. To put the new resin in, I used a large funnel. If you can have two people it is better; one to hold and shake the funnel and one to pour the resin in. It is kind of sticky, but pours well. If you don't have a funnel you can make one by rolling up some heavy paper. It is almost impossible to pour the new resin into the hole without a funnel. You need to make sure you get the tube back into the tank before pouring in the new resin and you should tape the top of the tube so you don't get any resin in it while pouring it in. Good luck!"

Even though you're not *supposed* to use LED's with this, I would think that as long as you have 60W total worth of bulbs running through it, it will be fine. For example, I currently have 6 recessed can flood lights running on one of these switches...if I switch to 65W-equivalent LEDs that will be roughly 57W...pushing my luck, but I expect it will work (I realize this isn't very helpful until I test it...just saying if it controls a single 60W incandescent bulb just fine, it should theoretically run six 10+ watt dimmable LED bulbs just fine as well.

Then you just grab it and slide it down towards the hammer itself, which allows you to insert the tips, then let go and they should be locked in.

It's a mechanical indicator, under a lens, that moves slowly as water passes over it; when enough water has run through the filter, the indicator starts to show red, and when it's completely red, it's time to change the filter. The problem is that it's not electronic, which means that it has no actual light itself, but rather depends on reflection from light outside the filter. I found that while I could sometimes see it at night with the light over the sink turned on, it was much more reliably visible by shining a flashlight down into the little port."

        "answer": "Yes, it will work to light (2) F40T12, (2) F40T12/ES, (2) F30T12 or (2) F25T12 (Shoplites). Now as for the physical size of the 2 units The Advance Measures - (6 1/2\"L x 2 3/8\"W x 1 1/2\"H) and the Robertson Measures - (9.44\"L x 1.38\"W x 1.16\"H). So, what you would have to do is slide the one end in the slotted corner like the original one and then mark and drill a new hole in the sheet metal housing and attach the unit with the screw at this point. I have replaced many of this type of ballast with these Robertsons in this fashion. Very simple process to do. Takes and extra minute or two to drill a new hole. Hope this helps!"

A typical Edison bulb would burn your hand if the bulb was touched. If you are using the bulb in a lamp it will not effect the bulb in the least.

Second: If you are asking about charging an 18v NiCad in this charger, the answer is No and yes. If it is a 130260001 (ordinary 18v) it will not fit. There needs to be an extra notch on the front right side of the shaft. AND if you do cut in that extra notch with a Dremel, it still will not charge. I guess that the charger senses the incorrect chemistry. BUT if it is an 18v Diehard (red release pads) 130279004 then the notch is there, it will fit in the charger and will charge properly. I have found that a 19.2v battery will fit into and drive my 18v drills and saws without any noticeable problem. Use that advice at your own discretion. Marty"

There is a tool provided to cut the blinds. When planning to cut the blinds, you should allow for say an 1/8 of an inch on each side to install the plastic ends that are also included that clip into the clamps at the top of the window frame and that give the blinds a professional finish at the bottom of the blinds."

I must also say this power string is much larger than ones you buy in the US but it is necessary for traveling in other countries."

        "answer": "I am not a professional groomer so you might want to check with one. Yes, I am sure it would work and assume you line brush when you dry? How long is a question I would be hard pressed to answer. I would think at least 45 mins. Yes,methinks it would work well on a Corgie coat but, again, drying always works best if you line brush. Do you show dogs? If not, line brushing is basically starting at the rear of the dog, holding up the coat with a brush so you get the undercoat so you are going against the lay of the coat. Continue on up the back of the neck or at least to the base of the neck. Then use the dryer so it blows with the lay of the top coat and brush towards the tail until dry. Hope that makes sense. Again, these dryers are great when a dog is blowing coat. I would bath my dogs, put them on a grooming table outside and blow and brush away all the dead undercoat. If course, you should use a grooming arm on the dog or have a person there to hold the dog."

If you are going to do a lot of soldering, like every day for years, I suggest that you buy a set and save the shipping charges later of the ones you may have don't fit.

        "answer": "The Ecobee thermostat is a two piece unit: the control unit that you put in your hallway and the equipment interface module which you put in your cellar near the furnace. When you buy the thermostat, you get both pieces and you need to use them both. They connect by the cable that your original thermostat used to connect to your furnace and AC, so you don't need to run a new cable. You then connect your furnace and AC to the equipment interface module. Piece of cake, right? WRONG! This is a very flexible and complex unit, and can handle all sort of fancy systems, so you really need to know what you're doing to connect it. I have a separate furnace, AC compressor, and air handler (and a degree in electronics), and it took me about 5 hours with the furnace and air-handler schematics to figure out how to connect this thing. It turned out the original contractors who installed the AC and furnace wiring made mistakes; my old thermostat forgave them but the Ecobee wouldn't. That said...I love this unit. It was worth the time and expense."

Because of the diameter of the blade it is probably limited to angled cuts with material no more than 1-1/2\" thick. Basically, it's a great \"cut off\" saw for materials less than 2\" thick. Just let it do the work and don't try to push it through even a 2 X 4 because you'll eat the motor bearings and then have a saw with one really bad Kerf. I know, I ate one of these by getting into a hurry. But I also bought a new one to replace it because it is a great tool if you don't abuse it as I did."

        "answer": "Yes, if you get sufficient sun exposure to fully charge the higher capacity battery. It takes six hours to fully charge the 1000MAH that comes with the N200, so a 1500MAH battery (MUST BE NiMH of the AA size) would likely take 9 hours of direct sunlight to fully charge. (In Winter I only get eight hours of light and six hours of 'direct' sunlight, here in Idaho. I wouldn't be benefited by a battery that large.) The thing is, that six hours of light at night is already enough in Winter (let's me burn the lamp from 4 or 5pm to 10 or 11pm) and MORE than enough in Summer (when the sun goes down at 10pm in Idaho), when you may need very little artificial light. So weigh the need for additional light against the cost. I might opt for a second bulb instead of a higher capacity battery. Two bulbs provide a solution that only requires six hours to charge and allows the choice of either longer run time or more light. And at the same time provides a back up unit."

Instructions can be found here: http://www.sargentandgreenleaf.com/pdf/630-302_6120_op.pdf What I have found is that the codes are stored on the lock itself and not on the keypad. So, if you are only changing the keypad (e.g. in a case where the battery has corroded the contacts on the keypad), then your original codes can be used to open the lock. You can go to the Sargent & Greenleaf support website for further details: http://www.sargentandgreenleaf.com/global-contact.php I hope that this helps you. I have used 6120 locks on two safes in the house for the last 17 years, and they work fine. I had to replace one keypad when a leaking battery corroded the keypad contacts. It is great when you can still obtain a replacement after 17 years!"

Typing the numbers was hard though - but probably because my leather gloves are old and it was hard to really focus and touch a number but it did work - so it's not like a phone screen (capacitative). With gloves with rounded finger tips (not old dried leather seam) it would work better."

        "question": "How can you claim it replaces 80W Fluorescent (2x40W 4ft T-12 tubes) when the product brochure clearly states the 24 watt model replaces a SINGLE 40w",
        "answer": "The second page of the brochure was updated in Dec 2013 due to the direct comparison to Fluorescent performance. https://app.box.com/s/gn93fk3r9n32dzkpqblo. The new brochure page 2 image was uploaded to Amazon, but for some reason is not propagating. The LED lights are DIRECTIONAL compared to fluorescent, which is OMNIDIRECTIONAL. This means that all the lumens of the LEDs are going downward in a 120 degree beam, compared to fluorescent, which has more than 1/2 of the lamp lumens in an upward and sideward direction. The reflectors of most shop lights are not efficient in \"bouncing\" the light properly and many fixture lumens are as much as 50% less than the lamp lumens (fixture efficiency~40-60%). The LED fixture efficiency is 100%, as indicated on the LM79 test report. Also, fluorescents are optimal at 75degrees F and will drop as much as 20% with a 10 degree variation in ambient temperature, and will drop as much as 60% or more at freezing. The LED will maintain its efficacy throughout a wider operating temperature range, and in fact thrives in colder temperatures. As you stated in your \"review\", the light is as bright as 2x the single 40W fluorescent. That is why the brochure was updated and the claim is made."

Our awning is 15ft. and one strand worked just great. Several people throughout the campground used the easy up shelters with more than one shelter side by side and then several of these lights hanging from those which looked to be connected strand to strand. YES they are very bright with the 60watt bulb. We did use a lamp dimmer plug/extension cord sold at the local hardware store in order to dim brightness as needed. While it was at full brightness they did attract the flying small bugs that look like flying ants. Once dimmed they went away. They are very useful for finding your camper. They are not tacky or too bright. Half the campers used these ..some with clear globes or all one color. The spiral flourescent bulbs will not dim. We had to use the regular bulbs in order to use purchased dimmer switch. This was the end of August in SC USA/ Surfside beach."

At 44, you would be able to produce about 2.0 GPM Flow Rate. http://www.ecosmartus.com/products/electric-tankless/eco-18/#product-tab3 I agree with Cliff. I am on my Fourth Tankless: two gas, two electric. This is by far the best design. The internals, wiring size, simplicity, layout are impressive. Best Value for the $ that I can see. My last electric was aweful. A soon as the flow rate would drop in the head, the heater wouldn't kick on. The ECOSmart has a proprietary sensor that kicks the system on even with a low flow rate. That is a great feature, as all three of my other ones required at least 1.0+ GPM to kick on and stay on. Best wishes."

        "answer": "This is a good option for garage doors. I wouldn't use it on windows because you couldn't see out. The good old stand-by for leaking windows (besides moving) was clear heavy plastic, which comes in rolls at your hardware store, and either taping or stapling it over the window frame included. The other if you are handy is to make a wooden strip frame for the clear plastic and make a sort of makeshift \"storm window\" that you can insert inside the window frame. Then you can caulk around the frame to eliminate drafts coming in that way. Years ago when we lived in houses that didn't have the excellent insulated windows we now have, this is how we eliminated cold and drafts from windows. Especially, if we were short on money."

        "question": "What does this mean: \"For each gallon of clean water, only 2 gallons of water are wasted\"? Where does the wasted water go? How is this economical?",
        "answer": "As D.R.Rowe said, the waste water goes down the drain. If the system is only used for drinking water, the waste is quite low because you only waste 2 gallons for every gallon you drink. This is just how RO systems work. The ratio is usually between 1:1 and 1:2, even for very large industrial RO systems. The \"waste\" water carries away the concentrated minerals and other things that can't pass through the membrane. Without this \"waste\" water, the membrane would become clogged in very short order. Instead, the waste water (usually called concentrate) flushes and carries away the blocked minerals and contaminants constantly as the system is operating. Keep in mind that the material blocked by the membrane has to go someplace! As for trying to use an RO system to provide your entire house's water supply, that would mean having a lot of waste as well as needing a very large RO system. What people usually do to deal with hard water buildup on fixtures and to also improve the operation of their dishwashers and clothes washers as well as make showers and toilets stay clean longer, etc., is to install a water softener to soften the water used in the house. The RO system is then installed after the softener to remove the sodium that a softener replaces calcium and magnesium with. That way, you get sodium (and other crud) - free drinking water. Your washing, bathing, and toilet water is \"softened\", but has high sodium in it so you don't want to drink it or cook with it, especially if anyone in the household is on a sodium-restricted diet. You install the water softener so that it does NOT soften your outdoor faucets. That way, you don't waste softened water on lawn and garden irrigation, etc. The sodium isn't good for your lawn or garden anyhow. If you install the softener and RO system yourself, you need to be aware of this and do the plumbing accordingly. If you have a plumber install the softener, they should already know this and install it correctly. They should also install the RO system after the softener so it starts out with softened water as its feed source. Doing this makes the membrane in the RO system last longer."

        "answer": "I have been using the HC6000 for the last 6 months, the same thing basically but with two sensors to control when to start and stop pumping instead of the smarts to turn off the pump using a single sensor and current sensing like the HC8000. The HC8000 didn't work for me as it didn't sense when to stop pumping correctly and would only pump the pit out halfway before quitting. That being said, while it was pumping it was drawing ~850 Watts (measured with killawatt power meter) running my Utilitech 0.5 HP sump, pushing up about a 4 foot head over a 110 foot run. That works out to ~7.5 amps. Most of the stamps on all electronics that state current draw overstate the actual need, so I bet you will be safe with the Zoeller. BTW, I had a great experience with the vendor. I had to return the 8000 to get the 6000 and process was easy. I wish the 8000 had worked for me because I loved only having a single wire, but not for me. Something about my setup must have confused it's internals. . . good luck"

The light fixture wattage limit is for avoiding heat buildup in the fixture.

If that is the main function of the router, I'd go with something beefier that has a 1/2\" collet. This is a great little router for trimming edges, round overs, ogees, etc. and for light jobs where you need a plunge."

The Moen faucet you select will have a drain cap and drain ring that matches the color of the faucet. You will use that cap and ring with the Moen 9000 when you install it. When you finished installing, no one will see what color the drain assembly is unless they look under your sink. Hope this helps."

This is a velcro set up, simply unscrew the original rubber backing pad and install the meguiar`s velcro backing pad, and stick the wool buffing/cutting pad right in it.

        "answer": "No. It means the maximum load you can connect to the outlet on the base unit is 10 Amps (115 watts). The total power draw will depend on the loads (appliances, lamps, etc) that you have plugged into the outlet on the unit. When turned off, the base unit itself will likely draw only negligible power from the AC outlet. The whole point of this gizmo is to cut off the power draw from appliances such as TVs, VCRs or DVD players which constantly draw \"standby power\", even when you think they're turned off, as long as they're plugged in. This remote switch will essentially \"unplug\" anything connected to it when you press the remote, so there's no more \"standby power\" being drawn constantly."

The instructions are not very clear. The paint job is not that nice and the bolts they used are just plain headed bolts. We will need to repaint it.

        "answer": "I have both the side and outfeed support on my saw all the time and I find them invaluable. There has never been an issue with the table warping or flexing. My side support does sag noticeably as you extend it from the table even when there is no load on it (must be the angle). If you adjust it for extended height it will be higher than the table as you push it in. What I do take a narrow board 2\" wide and 20\" long and clamp it to the inside of the side shelf support above the 2 rods. Pull the extension out to the distance desired. Set a level reaching from the table to the side support. Adjust the clamping of the board so that it is even with the table top across its entire length. Keep in mind that you can't hang a lot of weight on this. The outfeed support is sturdier and I have had no real trouble with the sagging. Again it isn't sized to support ripping long boards. I build a 36\" outfeed table for my DeWalt that attaches to the outfeed bracket easily handles 8 foot boards.

        "question": "If this ladder is IA rated 300 lb, and my own weight is (for example) 310 lb, does it mean I cannot use this ladder? Thank you!",
        "answer": "Your question posed a need to do a little research on my part because I am about to \"pull the trigger\" on a combination ladder. So, you must first realize that there are two different, but complimentary sets of Federal Regulations concerning ladder capacity; the engineering/manufacturing ANSI Standard and the workplace safety OSHA Standard. I found the following excerpt regarding the ANSI Standard: \"The most recent ANSI A14.1 and A14.2 standards only rate and have test procedures for 300 pound rated ladders. A new ANSI portable ladder standard for 375 pound rated ladders should be out later this year. The source standards for OSHA's portable ladder standards (1910.25 and 1910.26) are, however, ANSI A14.1-1968 and A14.2-1956, respectively. Any ladders designed in accordance with these previous ANSI standards are deemed to be in compliance with the OSHA standards. \"Although ANSI has updated its standards since the 1968 and 1956 editions, OSHA has not. However, on April 10, 1990, OSHA published in the Federal Register, Vol. 55, No. 69, at 13360, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which proposes amending OSHA's standards for walking and working surfaces and personal protective equipment. OSHA's ladder standards, including 1910.25 and 1910.26, would be replaced by the new proposed standard 1910.23. A copy of the proposed ladder standard is enclosed. \"Section 1910.23(c) of the proposed ladder standard reads as follows: (c) Design, construction, maintenance and inspection. (1) Portable ladders shall be capable of supporting without ultimate failure, the following loads: (i) Each non-self-supporting ladder: At least four times (4X) the maximum intended load applied or transmitted to the ladder in a downward and vertical direction when the ladder is placed at a 75 1/2 degree angle from the horizontal. (ii) Each self-supporting ladder: At least four times (4X) the maximum intended load in a fully opened position on a level surface.\" All of which would say that properly designed and manufactured step ladders under ANSI Standards meet their requirement to have been engineered to 4X the rated maximum working load. Someone answered previously that the working load is not just your weight but also adds the clothes, tools and items attached to the ladder to give one the total working load. So, your question leads to a number of answers which stem from the ANSI Standard for engineering of a step/extension ladder (and all other forms of ladders), Theoretically an A1 ladder is rated for 300lbs with an engineering margin that is many times that number. However other factors apply including the working load and the stability of the ladder (on varying surfaces, etc). For me I plan on acquiring an A1 and will watch my working load and stability closely during use. Hope this helps."

        "question": "does this check a good or not good capacitor?",
        "answer": "It depends on what you mean by \"good\". It will measure the low frequency or DC capacitance and you can decide if the value is within what you consider the proper spec. However, it will not tell you if the capacitor can withstand the the rated voltage. It also will not tell you the leakage rate for the capacitor. To determine the leakage rate you will have to charge it to a specific voltage, measure the voltage before disconnecting it from the voltage source, and then measure it again some time later, using a voltmeter with a very high impedance front end, so that the act of measuring the voltage won't discharge the capacitor. It also won't tell you the capacitance as a function of frequency. I hope that this helps you."

Credit to the clever Germans the HEPA filter is horizontal at the top so you could (in theory) fill the entire base of the unit with water and not get anything wet, whereas in a standard shop-vac you can only get a few inches before the filter gets soaked. The Festool is a good vac with a very specific purpose (like sanding drywall or lead paint indoors) .. for everything else there are better and cheaper alternatives."

The light is not your conventional soft white light but a very bright and crisp light. It is the same light you see in oncoming headlights of newer cars. Great to play cards by, eat dinner or to sit around at night at a patio table. I keep two lamps in a living room book cabinet and they light the entire living room area if on by themselves. I also keep one on auto-light in the bathroom on a high shelf so that when you walk into the bathroom late at night the light goes on offering plenty of light and stays on thirty-seconds after you walk out. If you've a room with few electrical outlets or an area where electricity isn't available, these lamps are excellent. You can get the batteries (Size D) in bulk package from Radio Shack at very reasonable cost."

        "answer": "Copper naphthenate is nothing new it has been around in exterior wood products for decks since the 80s. Cuprinol, Wittox-C, Osmose Cop-R-Nap were all products that contained copper naphthenate the ingredient that gave this product it's name. Cuprinol, Wittox-C, Osmose Cop-R-Nap all lasted 2 to 3 years on decks made with treated lumber just like all the rest. Remember the company that put out the Deck Restore is the same company that put out your Green Copper coating and you see the negative reviews for that. Wolman has been owned by many companies over the years and put out several coating for decks that all failed in 2 to 3 years. The paint companies keep repackaging the same old stuff with a few new ideas and people buy it I will say this one more time they will all fail on treated wood no matter what and I will bet my cash and my company name on it. As for your question yes it will fade and fail on the deck surface. Read the following on copper naphthenate. Ingredients, including contaminants, inerts, and by-products Copper naphthenate is a copper salt of naphthenic acid. Naphthenic acid is a complex natural mixture of fatty acids found in petroleum. It is a by-product of petroleum refining and has a variable composition.1 Ingredients, including contaminants, inerts, and by-products A typical copper naphthenate product would be about 19% copper naphthenate and 81% secret ingredients.2 The copper naphthenate portion is itself poorly characterized. Its composition depends on the composition of the source petroleum. The naphthenic acids may contain such constituents as cyclopentylacetic acid, alkyl-substituted cyclopentylacetic acids, fused chains of cyclopentylacetic acids, cyclohexylacetic acids, cyclopentanoic acids, and various low-molecular-weight fatty acids.3 It may also be contaminated up to 25% with hydrocarbons such as benzene from the petroleum source."

I think the caps are for access to the screws that secure it to the floor because it is still going to be attached to the floor even though it is also attached to the back. The one we replaced also had these caps on the bottom.

I used a 4\" paint roller to press out the cement, easier than trying to press them down by hand. Just use a normal pressure. Also we did not caulk the seams. They fit tightly agaist each other, that chaulking is a waste of time. labor and $$$ Wish there had been foam tiles like this when we bought our house in 2000! I would have had them up then!!

        "answer": "I would be worried if the manufacturer does not answer u back. The R O membrane stops most dissolved solids, which are small me ulema and bispenol-A or BPA is a fairly large molecule. Like it or not it is in our water, bottled or tap. The system seems to be made out of HDPE plastic, which is better than other types. The tank is stainless steel, hence no bpa, so as long as you do not expose ur sistem to acid or direct prolonged light you are safe for the first 2-3 years. I would recommend you get the 5 stage system, because the alkaline filter says \"electrolytes and etc.\" no one answered when I asked what etc mean, so I removed it. 5 stage is $169."

If you do not have three prong outlets you can buy adapters at the hardware store, they are very inexpensive. I bought 4 of the Lifesmart heaters last winter. I have a 2,700 sq ft house. In winter, I use 2 of them most the time and occasionally 3 and my house stays toasty warm! I live in Seattle. I am sure if you lived in a colder climate, say the mid West a 2700 sq ft home would require 4 units. I was at the local hardware store today. They have comparable units on sale for $249.00 each. Lifesmart units, look great and do a great job! I bought 4 of them for $400.00. I see the price went up about $10.00 since I bought mine. Still a great price and the best price I have seen. Also, Lifesmart Deluxe Units come with a 5 year warranty and other units only come with a 1 year warranty. Of course if you want to buy the EdenPure brand, the top of the line unit comes with a 5 year warranty, however, you will have to pay $399.00 per unit to get a 5 year warranty with EdenPure . I bought 4 Lifesmart units for the price of 1 EdenPure top of the line unit and have a 5 year warranty on all my units.

        "answer": "To add to Phillip's statement. This testor is designed to test cables. As you can see, the testor consists of a sending unit (the larger device) and a receive (the smaller device). Each device has two ports in which to insert one of the following, either an RJ11 (telephone / MOD6 plugs) or an RJ45 (data / MOD8 plugs). If you were testing a data or telephone cable, it would have a plug at each end, either an RJ11 or an RJ45. If you were testing a patch cable, you would insert one end in the sending unit and the other end in the receiver. If you were testing a cable with a jack installed at one end, and either an RJ11 / RJ45 plug at the other, then you would need a short patch cable to connect one of the devices to the jack end. If you were testing a patch panel to a jack, then you would need two patch cables to test the cable. The unit does not come with patch cables. I hope this answers your question."

Maybe Radio shack or Hi lights. You could also cut the wires and solder them back together. Putting \"Heat Shrink Tubing\" over the wires prior to soldering . Once soldered use a match to heaat the tubing and it will shrink around the wires thus insulating them. BE SURE TO REATTACH COLOR TO COLOR. I would also stagger the cuts to make the finished product not as bulky. Don't know if its worth the extra work just as ez to put in a matching wood filler Good luck"

        "answer": "I found the directions on the box to be quite poor regarding the suggested sanding. The 220 grit was not nearly enough and to my extreme disappointment the paint started to bubble off in a corner of my shower about 15 min after I completed the process. This in turn resulted in about 3 more days of work (waiting for it to dry completely, sanding again, building back the low spots, applying 2 final coats to even everything out) and my final product still doesn't look as good as it could have if the directions had just said to hit it with a harder grit straight away. Rust-O-Leum customer Service was good about helping with replacing the product -- I feel it was their fault due to the poor directions. I ended up using 4 kits in total. I'd recommend scuffing the whole thing with 80 grit DRY sandpaper. The whole tub will look extremely dull and scratched when you are done but that is the whole point. You need to get every bit of glossy surface and/or soap scum off so that the paint can stick. None of the scratches you make are going to show at all when you are done anyway because the paint self-levels and fills all the scratches in. In summary: Again, don't be afraid to scuff it up good with 80 grit (or 100 would work too). Hope this helps you be successful on the first try. I sure wish I would have been."

I used it on my polygrout in my shower and it works pretty good (use two or three coats). penetrates well, and you can't tell you used it other than the water beading up.

        "question": "can it mine stone",
        "answer": "'mine stone'? Not quite sure what you mean by 'mine stone', but it can be used in prospecting, where your intention is to strike stone to break it into smaller pieces to make handling and extraction easier. Is it a legitimate tool that a miner would use? Yes. Is it a good tool? Yes. Is it comparable to other tools in the same class? Yes. Could you take it into a mine and use it to dig at ore deposits? Yes. Can you use it to break rocks into smaller rocks? Yes. Keep in mind, it is a 'small' hammer, in that it is not a 28-36 inch pick, but more along the size of a carpenter's hammer. It is designed to work with rock and other stone materials. One end is a single-point rock spike, the other is a square-head hammer for crushing. This tool is NOT primarily designed to drive nails, but is designed to extract ores, precious and semi-precious stones, etc., from native rock (such as digging in creek banks during placer operations, or digging in surface or sub-surface mineral deposits, such as is found in lode operations). If you are seeking minerals or gems (let's say quartz), then this is IDEAL for cracking rocks to get to quartz, opening or shaping geodes, etc. I use mine often, and when placer panning, I carry it on a belt loop holder. If I have large stones that have color (read that as GOLD) in them, I can crack the stone open and crush it down so it will work through my sluice and then extract the gold from the crush. Does this answer what you are asking?"

For your application I would wet the area with water and then use a PVA concrete adhesive such as Sikalatex on the recess. When it is still wet use regular concrete mix just a little more water than usual to allow it bed in properly and keep the fill about 1/16\" below the garage floor surface. After it has dried for a week or so then you can use a thin coat of this epoxy to level out the filled area and feather it into the surrounding area. You can even sand it a little after it dries for 24 hours..."

        "answer": "laminate flooring is a pulp and paper product layered with either a plastic or wood sheet that is \"laminated\" onto it ... so, in saying that, most (if not all) pulp and paper products tend to insulate rather than transfer heat. So, it's not so much that you \"can't\" install it, it's more like will it do you any good to install it? most of the heat will not reach the surface like you want so I would say it's not a good idea to install it under laminate products (wood and plastic is also not a good idea). Tile(both metal and ceramic/porcelain) or concrete is fine. Hope this helps you out. Sheldon"

        "answer": "There are a couple different possibilities. * There could be an appliance downstream from the outlet that actually has a small ground fault. Try unplugging everything and see if it still trips * There could be a ground wire in an outlet box touching a neutral. To determine this you would need to pull the down stream outlets out of the boxes to inspect. You might be able to just remove the covers and look in with a flashlight, look for ground wires touching the neutral terminals, missing wire nuts, neutral wires with insulation missing, etc. * Another possibility is that a neutral from a different circuit could be connected to the neutral on the load side of the gfci. The neutral downstream from the gfci can only be connected to the same outlets the black wire is. This might happen in a electrical box that has both an outlet and a light switch fed from a different circuit. *You could also have a ground fault in a wall somewhere. A staple pounded into a hot wire somewhere. Not easy to find, or fix, but also not very likely. Hope this helps."

        "question": "Will this work as a direct replacement for a 2100T",
        "answer": "The 2100T and 2W are both \"2 wire\" smoke detectors. This means that the device gets it power from the same two wires it provides an initiating signal to the zone. Therefore \"2 wire\" detectors must be designed in such a way that its parameters fully match the design parameters of the zone and also of the panel when configured as a smoke zone. Since these two devices are both made by System Sensor and the 2W is intended to replace the 2100 in its line of detectors it is likely that the parameters match. The issue is that \"2 wire\" detectors must be listed (usually by UL) to work with the specific panel it is being connected to AND the panel must be listed to work with that particular detector. This is called cross listing. Listing is done by the testing agency (i.e. UL) by actually testing the specific detector on the specific panel. It is more common than not that the manufacturer of an older panel has not updated their panel listed by testing a newly released detector with that panel. In addition it is likely the new detector was not tested while being connected to an older panel. Note also, that a particular model panel's listing might be updated to be cross listed with a newer smoke detector but existing units in the field do not automatically have their listings updated - a panel firmware upgrade would be required. Though not knowing the panel being utilized the answer is probably no. It is likely that the 2W will work fine but without the cross listing one cannot be certain of this and installing the 2W in a panel it has not been cross listed for is a violation of NFPA standards and in most jurisdictions against local and/or state statutes."

[Do not release your grip on that lever while changing your code or you'll have no idea what numbers it set at.] Then release the lever once you've set your new code and it should work.

However, a factor you might think about is whether the plumbing fittings in China are compatible with this system. The main thing is to connect the Tee fitting provided with this system into your under-sink cold water line. My plumber had to use a different fitting. You may also need to drill a hole in the sink top for the water faucet to go through, and you need to find a place under the sink to attach the filter. Everything is provided in the kit. Once installed, you will need to replace the filter every year. This filter provides a very good flow of clean drinking water."

The AquaFinish will eat the rollers that they give you with the kit in about a minute or two. This is what happened to me, the rollers started falling apart and left bits & pieces of roller in my finish.

Basicly it's 2 devices in one. It's also easier to wire as it has a wall wart you plug in (usually on the celing right where you garage door opener is plugged into). Can be mounted externally and has screw down low voltage pins for the wires. The evolve needs to wire nut a few high voltage wires. Bottom Line its alot better then manually wiring a LFM-20, safer, easier, cost the same and has a sensor input and relay output in one device."

Now that i have discovered the use of Roebic Killer, rotor blades are not necessary. This process has saved me hundreds of dollars not to mention the time and mess of back ups.

Loosen the lever on the back of the saw and then adjust this screw in and out to get the blade square.

        "answer": "Honestly, I have not put the thing on a scale. Having used it now for 3-4 months, I can tell you that it is well balanced, not to heavy to do extended overhead work, and is flat out the best all around drill I have ever owned. I love this thing & I do not gush about products often, if ever. If you buy either, I would advise to stay away from the \"bit holder\" you can purchase as an option. It's terrible to the point that it just does not work. Junk. If they made a level you could attach in the same place (maybe they do, I have not really looked), it would be a much better expenditure of funds--even if it's only a $5 option, that is EXPENSIVE when it flat out is so poorly designed that I removed it from the drill and relegated it to the junk drawer. But I digress. I suspect you will not be unhappy with either drill and though I cannot give you an exact answer, I am downright giddy about the one I have & I expect it to offer no less than a dozen years of service (I pulled that number out of my ***). Of course the batteries are super expensive on these models and I am unsure if they can be rebuilt. Point being that I may have to get new batteries before replacing the drill--time will tell. The other side of that is that I have had good luck with batteries in general over the years and have found that if you take care of them, they will take care of you. The batteries I have are the lighter and slightly higher voltage Lithium Ion (came with unit) and they are known to have better tolerances, shelf life, etc. with the caveat being, to try not to drain them down to 100% (I think that there is a chip in the pack which protects them from that anyway) which unlike NiCad and Nmh, will harm the batteries. So a long read without really answering your question. Hope it helps you & if not, maybe somebody else. Note: Although I use my drill primarily on metal, I had an opportunity to use the hammer feature last week to go through some pretty tough concrete to anchor in some handrail. You might think that a cordless drill would not be up to the task. You would be dead wrong. Could not have been more impressed. Regards, Dan"

This is the amps which the breaker will trip. Hopefully you have a 20 or higher. For example, if you have a 20 and the heater pulls 12, that leaves 8 amps to spare and if you are at 120 volts x 8 amps, that is another 960 watts before it will trip. If your breaker is at 15 amps, then you cannot add much of anything else that pulls over 2 or 3 amps, to that circuit. You can put some child safety caps on the other plugs to remind you and others that that circuit if full."

Common ratings for these fan motors are 1050, 1075 and 1100 RPM. I wouldn't worry too much about it, but I do recommend replacing the start capacitor with a new one (that is rated for this motor 5mfd/370V Capacitor) when replacing the motor."

        "answer": "Sorry, I sold the piece on which I used them, but cabinet screws are a standard size (these were standard) so you should be OK. If the screws are too wide, just drill a slightly larger hole. If they are too small, the knob itself will cover the hole on the front, use a washer on the back if needed (unlikely) and make sure the knobs are screwed down nice and snug. Length is more what you have to be concerned about because of the variability of the drawer/cabinet thickness. But that's a problem that can be easily solved by buying longer (or shorter) screws. Most knobs come with longer screws that \"snap\" off these days. Can't remember what came with these."

Amazon has litmus test strips very easy to use and cost around $8 for 25 tests.

This is one of the best items i have ever purchashed from Amazon and knowing first hand how important keeping the bodies P.H. level regulated (bacteria thrive in our body if were too acidic) which is the cause for anything from heartburn to kidney stones. But with this great invention, all you need to do is drop it in a bottle of water, shake it (not necesary however) wait a few minutes and drink. Then just retrieve the stick after drinking what will now be some of the best tasting water you've ever tasted. (And for those below the don't think the product works? test the water before and after with a simple PH test strip (litmus paper) i believe is the name.A product you can obtain at any health food store or on Amazons site. You can also use PH drops obtained in the same manner. The water i used to drink went from red (acidic), and didnt change in color, this wasn't the fault of the test, but the water i was drinking was so acidic, it could not even be brought back to base!(alkaline neutral for the body, which should not be consumed by any creaature (and sadly is the most widely sold water in this country) But not sold to me anymore (or is one the waters I would give my worse enemy too.) The product works so well I have also turned one of the larger health food companies in my area on to it. The more alkaline you are, the healthier you'll stay. My father, who just turned 73, and was diagnosed 3 years ago with end stage liver disease can attest to that. He was given 2 days to 2-3 weeks to live, and to \"get his affairs in order\" and that was 3 years ago. (I joke with him that he is getting physically and mentally younger every year) and due to great products and supplements like this, he is thriving 3 years later! I can literally thank this every product ive got for him from amazon, for his continued great health. Were all made primarally of water, and that being said, cannot continue to survive and stay healthy, if our water in our bodies is to acidic. We become sick and die earlier than we should. I can tell you just about any doctor in the U.S. will tell you ph levels and vitamibs, herbs, and minerals do nothing for your body. \"We pee them out\" or so ive heard so many of tines. But what they fail to tellusis that anything that we leave behind in the toilet is simply what our bodies have gotten enough of. And thats a good insurance policy for me! I wanted to lastly mention that I do not work for any of these companies or amazon whatsoever, but will tell you that when I discovered would pH and alkalility meant for life, it prompted me to tell does many people as possible, thus starting my own business."

        "answer": "Eventually you'll find a dado blade set helpful. With the ever shrinking size of plywood today, I'd suggest you first use a router. You should have at least a two amp router that accepts a 1/2\" shaft. Make a \"t\" square guide to keep your cut straight. With the router you can make any width cut but will be limited to maybe a 3/4\" depth. If you are making dadoes in a lot of material a dado saw set will be faster but you'll find it challenging to accommodate the weird plywood sizes. Your saw also needs the power to use the dado set as well as the arbor length so you can add or remove blades and or shims to cut the dimension you desire Martin"

The table I use is an approx. 3x6 foot frame made up from 1x4s with a cross-grid of ladder-like rungs in the middle. It's a sacrificial cutting surface. It is placed over a couple sawhorses and provides support and clamping surfaces to run your track saw. When needed the Parallel Guides fit in between the cross-grid members. The 75\" track works better than the 55\" because of the extra length."

Obviously, you will lose some flexibility with the sander, but it will be a easier clean-up . If you use the plastic plate with the nubs on it to pierce the sandpaper, the sander does a pretty good job of capturing the dust in the collection bag.

If you run low pressure though a long 1/2\" pipe run, you will starve the heater of enough gas to lower the amount of BTU's it can produce. Yes, the regulator is 1/2\" but opens to 3/4\" pipe to reduce the friction. I had a short run in my house and did use 1/2\" pipe to the heater and used a 1/2\" to 3/4\" adapter at the heater.

You need to purchase it separately. The controller has to be one for wind generator (it should be included in the product description). Without the controller, the wind generator is useless. After you get a controller, you would get DC current with variable voltage reading. I did not attempt to use the current to charge a 12V battery. Instead I purchased a grid tie inverter to convert the DC current to 120V AC current and put it back in the grid. I believe it works fine.

        "question": "what is the difference between 1 and 2 stage furnace and how can I tell which i have?",
        "answer": "Single Stage Furnace The gas flame is either on or off. Consequently, the furnace waits for the temperature in the house to get cold--often colder than comfortable--before firing on. Then, the furnace rams the house full of heat until the thermostat shuts the system down. Two-Stage or Dual-Stage Furnace The two-stage furnace is a little smarter than the single stage furnace. Rather than a simple on/off operation, its flame can be on/high, on/low, or off. Adding this second flame setting makes a dramatic difference in energy costs. Two stage furnaces are much quieter than single stage furnaces and slightly higher cost. For a target of 72 degrees, actual temperatures in your house might range as low as 70 degrees and as high as 74 degrees."

        "answer": "It depends how wide your door is, and what size rod you bought. If it's a double door, then you'll want to add a bracket in the middle, as it'll tend to sag. These adjustable rods are made of two tubes, one of which fits inside the other, and is pushed in or pulled out to make the width you want. So there isn't the strength and rigidity you'd need to span a double door without its sagging in the middle."

Our light fixtures are 12 volts (we have solar power in our house) and we use these lights indoors. As long as whatever you're plugging them into is also 12 volts it shouldn't be a problem."

Regulated is usually 0.5 PSI and usually at most 15 PSI, a very different range. The valves, passages, etc are also made for these high pressures and at 0.5 PSI will likely not function or pass enough gas to do much. Then what ever you connect will also have a regulator, which will also not function properly with the low pressure and what ever you connect won't work. You need to bypass the regulator on your BBQ or what ever using the proper hose connection made for regulated pressure, to adapt it to connect to this connector would be vary dangerous because if anyone later connected to a regular tank at full pressure with no regulation massive gas would escape and possibly blow out hoses and lines not made for the pressure."

However, your furnace/AC will not be working. When the power comes back on the thermostat will re-establish contact with your WiFi and everything will be fine. If you go to the Total Comfort website you can set up an email message to be sent you if the thermostat looses contact with the WiFi. That is almost always because of a power failure. I love that feature as we live in Alaska and spend several months outside of Alaska at a second home in the winter. So I know when the power goes off and it notifies me when the thermostat re-establishes contact with the WiFi when the power comes back on. So if there is a lengthy delay I can call and have someone go and check our home out. Hope this helps."

        "question": "Can this be installed into the wall rather than on top of the wall?",
        "answer": "No. Not really. There are three main reasons for this. The first reason is that the water connection lines exit from the back of the unit. Thus, your supply lines would need to be behind the unit to make that connection. With typical 4\" stud depth and considering the depth of the unit itself, there wouldn't be enough room to make this connection. Possible solution is if you wanted to drill out holes in the bottom casing of the unit and make the connection from the underside. The second reason is that the connection for the hand held water sprayer exits from the side of the unit. As such, the unit needs to be mounted on the wall for this. Possible solution for this is to box out a niche around the sprayer connection, but that isn't exactly an elegant solution. The third reason is that once the unit is mounted in the wall and sealed you would have no easy access to the back of the unit for maintenance, leak checking or troubleshooting. Access would need to be made available from the back side of the unit and depending on your wall arrangement this may not be possible. It certainly wouldn't be very aesthically pleasing onthe access side."

        "answer": "The most important difference between this and a non-contact IR thermometer is that once you read a base temperature you can set the device to give a visual representation of any temperature differences. The way it does that is by changing the color of a bright spot of light it projects on the surface you are measuring. That was important to me because I am in the energy conservation business and I can use it to show my customers where cold air is leaking in around doors or windows or where heat is escaping to the outside. The light will go from green to red or from green to blue depending on whether the temperature is going up or down. Nothing beats a visual indication of what is going on and this gives you that. The light registers when you first read a base temperature then when it changes it goes to blue for colder or red for warmer in 1-5-10 degree increments depending on where it is set. Personally I am no fan of Black and Decker products. I avoid them as being cheap foreign made and low quality. However, this thing works for me and I have had it for two years without any problem."

The vanity doesn't have a lacquer finish like laminate cabinets do; it's wood. I've been very happy with the quality of the vanity for the price. You will need to calk around the shelf area where the legs attach every couple of years because the you get a little surface crack but it's nothing major and you really can't beat this vanity for the price."

Amazon has the same picture for both batteries. The newer battery ($69) should say RED Lithium the older battery says Lithium-Ion. The difference between the Red Lithium XC and the Lithium-Ion XC is 4Wh. (4 watt hours). The Regular small RED Lithium battery is 16watt/hour the Lithium-Ion XC is 28watt/hour and the newer Red Lithium XC is 32 watts. So is the extra 4 watts worth $7.50 a watt?? I'm not sure what the extra benefits are of the RED Lithium other than increased amperage and hype.

        "answer": "You cant use ceramic rod sharpeners due to the single bevel grind. It is easy as it is only one angle to worry about instead of two like a hollow grind. But you must use a flat stone. Look into Smith's tri hone stone sharpener it has all 3 grits you need to get an edge. You can use soapy water or honing oil with the stones never use dry. Once you place the knife flat on the stone start lifting the angle edge side of the knife until it stops and start sharpening. There is a video on youtube how to sharpen a mora and the guy used that sharpener thats why I got mine. Hope this helps"

        "question": "Is this chrome painted plastic or all metal?",
        "answer": "These days many items are chrome plated plastic. Think of your car. This shower head and hose appear to be a mix of real and plated. Some pieces appear to be all metal, while others are most likely chrome plated. I am not an expert in these matters. I will say that we've had many different shower heads over the years and this one is the most exquisite. The hose doesn't kink ~ ever. Hygiene experts recommend that a person change these things every so many months or years... I don't remember how often they recommend changing, so I am considering purchasing a second one of these to save so when it's time to change, I'll be able to continue to shower in luxury. Then, of course, I may try that vinegar in a baggie over the head trick I read about. There's so much to know about daily life, like who would have guessed you're best to turn on your shower with real hot water and let some of the trapped water spray out before you get into the shower and breath the air of that stale water... Common Cold, any one?"

You just position them at the edge of the cabinet as shown in the picture in listing -- not a big deal! Less than 5 minutes for a set of 2 doors. The key is a power drill with that extension on it! Oh, and if you want to maximize the space in your cabinet's interior, be sure to mount the stops at the top of the cabinet, not the bottom. They DO take up space behind them but if they're at the top, there likely won't be anything back there so you won't lose any of the storage area! I have some that are mounted on the bottom but only on cabinets that I don't load up very much. They were difficult to get to and mounting on the top would have been a little too difficult for me on my ladder."

If you want the lights to turn on when the magnet is removed, then use a normally-closed switch... if opposite then use a normally-open."

My garage is 28 x 24 and it takes maybe 15 minutes to go from forties to 70ish. I just flip it on in AM, drink some coffee and eat breakfast, and then go to the shop. It is toasty when I get there."

The only other guess I have is that while using another type of pump I put in some really old liquid soap that the lost a lot of it's liquid so it was really think.

        "answer": "Hi, Maybe I can help. The lamp plugs directly into the wall outlet via a very, very long circular, \"lamp cord\" with a three-pronged plug at the end. The lamp cord is about as thick as the one used by my cable company to wire my cable TV system. It is also less flexible than a typical lamp cord. To attach the lamp to the ceiling the company includes a metal hook that you screw directly into the ceiling, sort of like the hooks you use to hang a plant (only less decorative), AND a three inch long \"S\" shaped piece of plastic with a small hole at one end. To attach the lamp to the ceiling, first screw in the metal hook. Then, attach the \"S\" shaped plastic piece to the hook using the small hole on the end. Finally, you thread the lamp cord \"in\" and \"out\" of the \"S\" shaped piece of plastic. The lamp is held in place by the tension created by \"threading\" the lamp cord through the \"S\" shaped piece of plastic. Sorry for being \"long-winded\", but I hoped this helps. BTW, I use mine in my bedroom suspended above the end table with a 40 watt yellow light bulb, and I like it very much. Also, it is very utilitarian looking, not fancy. I happen to like that look."

        "answer": "Fluidmaster makes this model as well as many more for other brand toilets. But Kohler uses a Fluidmaster PerforMax model with a bag of click-in restrictors found in the Fluidmaster Pro45U model kit. Kohler just brands it with a Kohler embossed top. HOWEVER, what makes Kohler-Fluidmaster's version unique is the water inlet towards the bottom of the fill valve is about an inch from the tank bottom. This is so Kohler can use it for regular tanks and foam insulated tanks- smart! Also included are the flow restrictors needed for different types of Kohler toilets. Instructions included to figure that out. So to answer your question, \"no\", I did not get a regular Fluidmaster 400A fill valve. I received a Fluidmaster PerforMax/Pro45U built to Kohler's specifications. If you check prices the PerforMax, Pro45U and Kohler fill valve are very close in price. For that reason I always choose the Kohler version."

From there you can attach an adjustable elbow (purchase separately, the big box stores have them) that you can adjust to allow a straight up and down pipe through your attic.

The GXL-Next uses an acid based liquid to test while the AGT3 uses a saline (salt water) solution based liquid to test.

The pump provides the necessary psi water pressure needed to make the eccotemp operate. I use a similar system here in the Dominican Republic. Water here comes via gravity feed from a 400 gal tank on the roof, but this is not enough psi feed to make the eccotemp operate. Hence the 12v waterpump. This is how I get hot water here without having to use very expensive electricity. Hot water when and where you want it. Has worked flawlessly for past year - 20 gal propane used in 1 year C. Poole"

If your water heater has an element that is less than 2400 watts, and runs on a 120 volt circuit, yes you can use this. It is not likely that your water heater meets these requirements. You can, however, use this switch to switch a relay that is rated to turn your water heater on and off. An inexpensive example of this is the Packard C230B. It will switch 220 volts up to 6600 watts and has a 120 volt coil. This is a mechanical contactor. You can also look for a solid state relay that will be quieter and last longer, but cost more."

Much as your hand holds the panel with your thumb on one side and your fingers on the other, just so, the clips grip the panel. Typically, you have clips that are designed for 1/2 inch plywood. If you run out of the half and need to use it with 3/8 plywood, a pair of vise grip pliers canbe used to squeeze the U shape part to grip the thinner panels. Now for the rest of the clip. Thinking again in the hand analogy, imagine that your fingers are the point of a V bend in the metal strip that makes the clip. The part of the clip that leaves your finger tips and goes up along the back of your fingers extends beyond your knuckles and has the \"teeth\". In use, the portion with the teeth are on the outside of the panel- the side near you. As you push the panel into the window opening, the portion of the clip with the teeth will be dragging on the bricks and essentially pulled away - the V is opened up somewhat.

The faucet base is 2.0 x 2.1\" with the handle extending laterally 3.07\" from the center of the base. The faucet I 10.5\" tall and extends laterally 4.5\" from the center of the base. Culligan says 6 month / 500 gallon life. I have used up to 8-9 months with still a huge improvement over the unfiltered tap water, but I can taste a little bit of minerals at 8-9 months. This while using about 1.5 gallons a day, average. And, I do not have a bulk filter at the input to my house."

I bought a few of these and the red color stopped working within a few minuets, and actually burned part of the circuit board assay (smoked).. The blue and green still work great, but all the shades of light that are generated from combinations of two or three bulbs flicker too much to be used.."

Two 2ah batteries will allow you to keep working while recharging the other battery. However I have one 4ah battery for my pole saw that lasts as long as I do. There are other pages on Amazon that correctly describe the battery as 2ah or 4ah. You may want to order from a vendor that more accurately describes his product (I looked and didn't find a better description that was compatible with the same charger as the one you are considering). Also confirm that the battery that you order is compatible with the charger. I see that there is ample opportunity to get a mismatch.Good luck.

        "question": "How wide of a cut can you make with the GR200 and what is the practical cut width limit - i.e. at what width is it better to use the saw blade guard?",
        "answer": "I'm assuming that you mean making a cut while spanning the GRR-Ripper over the blade. None of the following measurements allow for blade clearance, so your actual ripping widths will be reduced by that clearance amount. Maximum distance from fence to inside edge of GRR-Ripper is 3-3/8 inches. Attaching the accessory gripper foot against the fence adds an inch, totalling 4-3/8. Mounting the stabilizing leg instead adds just under 2 inches, totalling ~5-5/16. I suppose you could add the flat accessory plate, gaining several inches, but the rig will easily skew against the fence and there is absolutely no reason to pass over the blade at that point anyway; it's just unnecessarily dangerous and the basic GRR-Ripper should be used as a conventional push block alongside the blade. To summarize, you can rip widths from about 1/4 inch (between blade and fence, as shown in their demos, though that gets the blade very close to plastic) up to about 3-1/4 inches with minimal blade clearance if you're very careful. Mounting the accessories takes that width to about 5-1/8. The GRR-Ripper is 3-5/8 outside width, so it's just as easy to go beside the blade at that width, and probably more stable. The height of the GRR-Ripper, when passing alongside the blade, keeps your knuckles farther from danger; mine are about 2-3/8 inches above the surface of the stock, so unless I just wildly throw my hand into the blade, I feel safer than feeding with a conventional push block, or certainly bare hands. If you do call your clearances too close and cut the plastic, there's no harm done beyond some expensive replacement parts. As a side note, if you want to play Jack the Ripper, you can allow the blade to protrude a full inch above your stock before it cuts into the top of your GRR-Ripper. I've said this before, but this is such a great product, superbly made, that I can't imagine risking my hands with unwieldy push sticks and short push blocks. I cut my left index finger with a knife in a moment of utter stupidity and have some joint and nerve damage. Every time I used typical long, wobbling push sticks, I had a thousand questions per second about where the saw was going to throw the wood--or the stick--when something slipped, and where my hands would fall in the confusion. With two GRR-Rippers, I am as comfortable at the saw as I am resting my hands on the kitchen counter. Total stability and confidence. Buy two, use them wisely, and keep your hands to hold your great-grandchildren."

        "answer": "The SC600 is more of a flood light. Generally, you can get a better idea by looking at the reflector. If it's a smooth reflector, then it'll have a greater hot spot that is used for throw. If it has an orange peel reflector, then the light is dispersed more evenly for better spill and flood. However, it's the shape of of the lens and where the LED is positioned that will determine if it's actually a thrower or not. In the SC600's case, it has a shallow orange peel reflector so it's a better flood light with more spill."

Plug a radio into the same room in which the light bulb is out and turn the radio on. Turn the sound up so it's rally loud. Listen for the music to stop as you flip switches in the circuit box. If the music stops you have cut all electricity to that room. It should now be safe to remove the stuck/broken off light bulb base from the socket using this tool."

        "answer": "The main faucet can be used for the output of the Culligan filter OR the output of your regular water line, not both. If you modify the line from the filter to replace your main water line, you will get a VERY reduced flow. When you wash your dishes it will feel like a trickle coming out of your faucet. To use only one faucet, but switch between the two input lines, (To switch between the regular water input line and the filter input line using only one faucet) - I would recommend calling a plumber. I wouldn't know how to do that. So the real answer is that using only the equipment provided by Culligan you cannot use the main faucet. You have to cut a hole in your sink at the counter level and install the new faucet."

        "question": "I have a Helix skimmer set in a 5,000 gallon pond. I am looking to replace my pump do you think it will fit with the Helix skimmer?",
        "answer": "not sure if it will fit your Helix, however, I bought this pump, which worked well for about 4 hours. I realize anything can be defective, but the damage to the unit caused by this obviously cracked impeller was just incredible. there was no repairing this thing. I sent it back, and requested a refund, but was sent another pump, .... after I had closed the pond for the winter. so, I really don't know if this one is ok. the entire unit is cheap plastic. if it stays together, there is a lot of water pumped out of it. it actually sounds a little anemic though for a 4-5000 gal pond. mine is around a 1000, and this would have been perfect. beckett has been around a long time, and made good on the problem, but I waited a little longer for it than was appropriate, especially if it was in the middle of the season. I will use this one once I get things going again in a couple weeks, but I will buy a high quality one also, and keep the beckett for backup. the one that I had originally replaced was an aquascape, and it was way old, so they last. but they cost too. I'm going to buy a new aquascape one anyway. it's not worth cheaping out again."

Batteries go in the hole. Then make sure black piece is screwed back on tight. If it's not firm and tight, a circuit won't be completed. Next --- the button needs a good push.

        "answer": "ECO 110 is the model number. It definately uses 220v to power it. And not any normal 220v connection will work. You need 8/3 NM wire at minimum and preferably 6/3 nm wire for it to run effectively. Which means special breaker in the electric panel (50 amp), special wire run to the unit, and a special connection/plug at the unit. In most states you can not do this yourself legally. You need an electrician to do it."

        "answer": "It's possible technically, but it's not a good idea. However if it's just a bar or a prep sink, then it becomes more viable provided you have correct expectations. So in short, no, it should not be connected to the cold water feed on your kitchen faucet. There isn't enough water. The system has a 3.2 gallon reservoir tank, which is more than enough for drinking and cooking use, but it's not enough to feed a kitchen faucet which dispenses water at 2.5 gallons per minute. If you were to connect it to your kitchen faucet, turn on the water, and then turn your back for a minute to tend to your kids or answer a text, by the time you turned back around the tank would be dry and you'd have to wait a couple of hours for more water. As an alternative to drilling a new hole you can go to a \"tri-flow\" faucet with hot, cold, and filtered water inputs. Or if you sink has more than one hole, but the current faucet occupies all the holes, then get a single handle faucet, remove its base-plate, and use the extra hole(s) for the RO faucet (and a soap dispenser if possible)."

        "answer": "Hi, I think I've used the stopper once or twice since I've had my sink, and when I did use it I never saw any rust at all. The only time I had to deal with a rust issue was when I was cleaning a pan with an SOS pad. I got a tiny bit of metal under one of the feet of the rack that sits in the sink. Stainless steel is very resilient and if you care for it properly it will look good and won't rust. I cleaned the tiny tiny spot of rust with a dab of Barkeepers Helper. I swear by that stuff. Also stay away from egg white on stainless. It doesn't hurt a cooktop because the heat fixes that, but I dropped a spot the size of a dime on my sink. I didn't realize it was the egg white until I tried to clean it after breakfast. When I got the rust stain, and managed to fix that with Barkeepers Helper, I thought I might as well try it on the egg white stain. To my surprise and great happiness it has taken away the spot!! Warning, be careful how much you rub and how hard. Be gentle or you'll leave a tell tail spot where you've been working. Just gently, with a wet micro cloth, put a little water and a little BH on the cloth and work on the spot. Then when you've done, rinse off the area you are focusing on and then rinse out the cloth and wipe down the whole area. You can do this to water spots also. I have very hard water in my area and I manage to get drips down the front of the sink and on my refrigerator, which is stainless. Stainless steel is beautiful, but it does take some care. I hope I haven't bored you will my information, but I like my new kitchen to look like it did when it was installed a year and a half ago, and it does."

        "answer": "Yes, you can't do both. I did a free style small pitch under the liner and used the Quick pitch to get the proper pitch needed when tiling. The under liner pitch is not so critical since it is a safety/back up. Most installers don't even put a pitch in the under liner. This kit worked great, I just wish the it came with more bars or slightly longer. Also I recommend painting the shower walls and floor with a rubber paint before tilling. It is the best insurance against shower leaks. Hope this helps."

Is there any chance you could pump your shallow well empty or down to a level where the pickup pipe will be below the level of the water in the well? The pump cannot be ran without water to the input. It is not a self priming pump. 2. Does the irrigation system have an \"on-off\" timer. If so, then some method will need to be devised to prime the pump. Again, the pump cannot be ran without water at the input. 3. Are there approximately the same number of sprinkler heads in each of the three zones? If there is a large difference in the number of sprinkler heads, the pressure to each zone will vary and un- even results will occur."

        "answer": "That information is incorrect. I have stayed at quite a few hotels and most of the time, the lock will fit the door properly. However, doors are not standardized in hotels. The gaps between the door and the door frame vary. For this lock to function, the metal plate has to be able to fit inside the door and the door frame. If the plate will fit in that gap, the lock should work without any problem. It is very easy to check if it will work just by sliding the locking plate into the gap. If it slides in, it should work. Now I did have one door it did not work on when in fact, it slid into that gap. This particular door had an unusually wide dead bolt on it and it would not go through the plate. I can tell you, when you have this lock installed, you can not open the door at all until you remove the wedge, even from the inside of the hotel room. It is dependable and it works but it isn't a universal fit on all hotel doors throughout the world. Take care."

So . . . it should be able to go where your EXISTING anode is. Additional bit of useful info -- when the factory installs the original in the hot water heater, they use high-speed, high-torque wrenching devices. To quote one of the factory reps, semi-jokingly -- it takes 6 men and lots of beer to get it loose. In reality, you will need a hefty socket wrench AND a metal pipe that fits around the handle of the wrench to achieve enough leverage, to loosen the factory set rod. GOOD LUCK!"

However, I can say that the level of sound from the heater is dependent upon the mode it is operating in. When operating at full output, the fan is operating at high speed and thus generates a level of sound consistent with any fan operated room heater which I would classify as moderately noisy. When operating at \"idle\" speed it is very quiet all of which is dependent upon the thermostat setting relative to room temperature. If you desire a very quiet heater, then I would suggest a radiant type heater that does not have a fan."

I spent a day trying to buy one at my local hardware stores (not in stock) and when I returned to Amazon on 2/21 saw that there was the usual quick delivery available, so I ordered the First Alert 3120B from Amazon and received it soon after."

The colored wires are the \"hot\"or power wires. The white wire is the \"neutral\" wire. The relay has terminals on the left side and right side that each have a screw above them. This where the colored wires go, one under each screw. On the opposite side of the relay, there is another pair of screws. This is where the colored wires from the \"appliance\" or device go. The white wire from the electrical box connects to the white wire from the appliance. The switch that controls the relay connects to the 2 spade connections with the coil of wire underneath them. The colored wire from the switch is the \"hot\" wire and connects to one of the spade terminals. The other spade terminal connects to a white/\"neutral\" wire. When the switch is closed, power goes to the relay coil, closes the relay, and that completes the connection between the wires under the screw terminals and the appliance or device. Hope this helps"

        "answer": "How did you try to measure 24 volts? If you used 2 twelve volt batteries in series make sure they were connected one + lead to the other - lead. Or try to measure 3 nine volt batteries snapped together. You should get 27 volts. I think there is a calibration pot on the back of the meter. It is very small and you will need a jewelers screwdriver to adjust it. Make sure the red lead goes to the + termingal of the battery. Try again and let me know. You could have a bad batch of meters. Mine worked very will on my power supply that goes up to 27 volts. One last thing...are the 24 volt batteries you are measuring good batteries? The meter might be telling you that they are not. Hope this was useful. Also be aware that all meters have a percentage of error. Some are + - .1% + - .01%. No matter how expensive the meter it will have error tho very small. The smaller the error, the larger the price. These cheap but beautiful meters are good enough for battery monitoring. I wouldnt use them to build a computer power supply."

        "answer": "There is no real model number to speak of. The light is around 1200 true lumens. Which means it is very very bright. The light last on high for approximately 3 to 3 1/2 hours. On medium approximately five 5 1/2 hours. On low approximately seven hours. This is a really nice headlight. I personally purchased two of them and as a result the CEO of the company sent me a free extra battery. He is very nice and personally responds to any questions and sends you a personal hand written thank you letter upon your purchase. The rear light is a free courtesy light that is a silicon light. It runs on CR 2032 wafer batteries. If you order a light contact Don is his name and ask him to send you an extra package of the rubber rings that attaches your headlight. If you have a problem with the light spinning on the handle bars because of vibration and/or bumps you can take a little grip tape and apply around the handlebar and that will stop it from moving. Grip tape can be found at your local athletic or sporting good store. I hope that this information helps you. I highly recommend this light. The light and the CEO of the company are of high-quality. Have a great day and happy trails."

        "answer": "A big wide Shape-5D 5x1mm tip that looks a bit like a flat-head screwdriver. For electronics, it is only suitable for soldering large terminals and connectors. Adapting it to take significantly smaller tips requires a difficult-to-find part (a new nut/shroud to hold smaller tips down). Other people say that the tip sizes that come with this are very suitable for stained glass work."

        "answer": "You measure the size of the grill, either inside diameter (duct) or the grill face itself in inches converted to square feet use the ft/min to determine cfm. Some companies use a duct that is modified to fit over the exhaust tubing and convert the exhaust or intake to a circular dimension and then take measurements. Multiple measurements are necessary on a grid pattern, at least 20, which are averaged and taken about 6 inches from the grill face at 90 degrees to the flow. Readings will vary upwards of 10 percent. For accuracy, it is a good practice for one person to measure the flow and the other to write down the data, plus use the averaging method on the instrument itself. The two person rule is a good idea for working off a ladder. The average cost on a call out plus the certified report averages about $1,000, so the anemometer is very handy to check and balance the system prior to having a certified technician do a survey."

Adding a resistor ahead is only done if feeding it more than its operating voltage and for only experts - this unit does3~30V so 12V is perfect within range.

        "answer": "I have bought a dozen of these flashlights over the last five years. Initially, they all had the same problem, the switch would only work if held part way on. The answer below this from R. Hennigh about a loose retaining nut is worth a shot, but for all twelve of mine, here's what I had to do, and what I'd recommend you try first. Unscrew the head and tailcaps of the flashlight and remove the battery. Hold the body tube up towards a window or a lamp...can you see through the tube? If not, take a long drift pin, a long dowel rod, anything that can take a good whack and not break...insert into the body tube from the tail (switch) end...when it contacts the plastic disc obstruction in the body tube, hold the tube tightly, and whack the rod with a hammer...HARD! When you dislodge the black plastic disc with the little brass colored rivet in its center, THROW IT AWAY! It serves no purpose, and stops the flashlight from working. Once removed, reassemble the head-end, re-insert the battery, and twist the switch cap back on...it should work fine now. Those caps were supposed to ensure the battery was inserted the correct way...the rivet is slightly indented on the tube side, and slightly proud on the head side. This would stop the flat negative side of the battery from making contact with the L E D driver circuit and destroying it due to reverse polarity...BUT...most 18650 battery positive end tips DO NOT fit the recess in the disc, so it prevents the flashlight from working AT ALL!! I have bought 12 of these lights...had to \"modify\" all of them. I carry two on me at all times, I have several in my vehicles, and have given some as gifts. In 5 years, the ONLY problem I've ever had was the initial need to modify the lights. Other than that, they are blindingly bright, highly reliable, light weight, and hold a charge regardless of the temperature of the vehicle they are stored in for months at a time. Good luck, and let me know how you made out!"

I don't specifically recall the warrantee information on this product, but as will all items I've purchased on Amazon, that's probably an easy question to get answered from either the vendor, Amazon or the manufacturer. By default, I bet it has a 1 year warrantee. I've had mine for a while and used it quite a bit with no issues. It's already paid for itself, so if it broke tomorrow, I wouldn't be that upset. I'd just buy another one just like it and weld away.... Thanks. L. Earnest"

        "answer": "Dear OldAmazonian: Any time you put 150 ftlb on a 1/4 inch you are asking for trouble. You will be twisting, stripping etc with that much force. Your adapter will take the punishment for a while but fatigue will take over. There are different grades of tool steel. The reason they have \"Impact sockets\", is because they are beefed up to take the force of the impact driver. Regular sockets will also work but the square hole becomes quite worn with repeated use and eventually the socket will fail."

        "answer": "M.T. Pawketts, not sure what your skill level is, so if this response is way too basic or wordy for you, I apologize. Hopefully, I won't confuse the issue any more than it already is, but, here goes. First, here is my understanding of how to determine LH or RH: IF, WHEN STANDING ON THE EXTERIOR SIDE OF THE DOOR, FACING YOUR HOUSE, THE DOOR HANDLE IS ON THE LEFT, HINGES ARE ON THE RIGHT, AND THE DOOR PUSHES IN, IT IS A RH DOOR. In my case, I have a right-hand door. Therefore, AS THE HARDWARE IS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE, THE SMALLER LEVERED HANDLE ON THE RIGHT shows the handle pointing to the right, which is EXACTLY OPPOSITE OF THE SET I BOUGHT FOR MY RIGHT-HAND DOOR. The smaller levered handle should actually point TOWARD THE DOOR'S HINGES, and not hang over the doorframe moulding, of course. AS PICTURED, THE HARDWARE WOULD BE FOR A LH DOOR! By the way, I have had the Schlage digital keypad locks on all three of my exterior doors - front, side, and back doors - for a good long while now, and they have operated flawlessly, with batteries seeming to last forever. They are ruggedly constructed, look great, and are precision made, as compared to others out there. They were well worth what I paid for them. I hope this helped. Good luck with your purchase and installation! wbc"

So for us it is worth it since we have probably a hundred rechargeables in various devices. Since we've had our rechargeables for years, many are reaching the end of their life. This charger allows us to determine which batteries are no longer any good and not worth the time trying to recharge (without realizing we had been trying to charge the same battery over and over). It has also allowed us to recover a few batteries we thought might be bad but just needed to be discharged. If you have less than a couple dozen rechargeable batteries, then you should look at a more basic charger."

Note: it is NOT a classic circular motion orbital sander, its motion is more elliptical than circular. That being said, it still works fine. I've used it on a kitchen table and it did a great job. Note: non orbit sanders MUST be used across the grain while orbital (or elliptical) sanders work fine either way. I would suggest getting \"non clogging\" sandpaper since this has a vacuum bag and non clog works best with this sort of thing. Finally, remember to use a tack rag or a faintly moistened towel to remove ALL the wood dust before you stain or paint or glue. Cleanliness is a must."

Regarding the other two wires (brown and blue), even though it's AC and to remain standardized, the \"brown\" wire is considered \"hot\" (Black wire in USA), and the \"blue\" wire is considered \"neutral\" (white wire in USA). Thus, \"green/yellow\" wire connects to USA \"green\", \"brown\" wire connects to USA \"black\", and \"blue\" wire connects to USA \"white\". If you're confused, my apologies...just Wikipedia it...Wiki even has pictures!!! To summarize, green/yellow to GREEN, brown to BLACK, and blue to WHITE. Just a footnote,the other connection will work....it's just not \"standard\"."

        "answer": "I would think as long as the wood is structurally sound overall you could use it. You need to remove all the rotted wood that can easily be scraped away and get to the good wood that is too hard to remove. Then use the hardener. Then poly coat it the next day. This should not be confused with products that supposedly seep into the rotted wood and harden it all up....this is used to harden the wood not quite rotted so the damage does not continue. Whether you fill the areas removed is up to you."

The frame is made out of that \"Slinky\" like metal that in can fold up. Kind of like a child's play tent if you have ever seen one of those? The problem is does not come out of the package well where it will keep the shape of a door. It kind of will bend at the top or bottom and not stay flat to the door unless it is modified or hooked shut. When it is hooked shut, that means it can only be unhooked from the same side. In addition, it would need to be hooked at the top and bottom. I wouldn't buy one. Your better off buying the cheapest screen door you can find that actually has a latch and firm frame. I have been through SEVERAL Magic Mesh's variations and screens. I have now decided to just buy an actual screen door for my garage. I wish I had done that initially instead of wasting the money on these products that either don't last long or have annoying \"complications\". Good Luck."

I recommend the later course... make sure the right size and get them less expensive... using the sampling to compare for local screw sizing.

        "answer": "Well you've already received 2 responses but for what it's worth I did receive a material clamp with my saw. Similar in design & function as the one I use on my Porter Cable 12\". As for any slop or undesirable movement when fully extended I can say that I haven't experienced any problems. If you don't have a bench top to place your saw, I would highly recommend the Dewalt DWX723 Heavy Duty Miter Saw Stand. Easy to set up, you can set up either side for material support or positive stop if you plan on cutting material the same length over & over again. It is absolutely solid & I've been impressed with the design. Hope this helps you. Good Luck."

The light source is made up of a grid of smaller LED modules in series / parallel all very close together. This grid of LED modules is connected to a heatsink that dissipates the heat to the lamp housing. Separating the LEDs for a different voltage is not something worthwhile or recommended.

And as always, if you run the LED at 2 to 4 volts under rating you can actually barely tell and yet extend the life of the LED for much longer.

It didn't hold up well so this time we bought the chrome. Incidentally, I did something stupid and broke a part of the Kohler fauctet last week. I contacted the Customer Relations of Kohler, and they are sending me a complete new faucet under warrantee after over two years. It speaks well for the company."

That might be a question best addressed by the company. Books, especially hard bound are very heavy. Take care moving the filled bookshelf. Those can be top heavy and dangerous to move, due to the weight of it. Based on the dimensions you mentioned, a rectangular or square slider at each corner should support the unit. A little open space between each slider should pose no problem. Good luck and let me know how you make out: mikew2011@comcast.net"

He didn't tell me the amount to use and I was a C- chemistry student in school. He retired about that time and I went along calling \"Roto-Rooter\" until I found this stuff in a catalog and bought it. I have a bottle that I'm going to dump in my system for the six month dose and the label indicates it is 99% Copper sulfate pentahydrate and 1% \"other ingredients\". I have used it for years now and have never had to make a service call to have my line \"snaked\". I've stayed with it because it has worked for me all these years and also because my ignorance of chemistry keeps me from wanting to use an inappropriate dose of copper sulfate that might screw up the pipes leading to the sewer and cost a large out of pocket expense for repairs. I hope that's helpful. Good luck!"

        "question": "the picture is too large and covers the description. What's the input voltage?",
        "answer": "I'm not sure what the \"input voltage is 110-240V\" means, but please disregard that! The rated voltage drop across the LED module is stated to be 30-34V. But everyone using LEDs should be aware that the correct way to drive any LED is to regulate (limit) the current through the LED, not drive them with a constant voltage. LEDs, at their simplest, behave like any diode in most ways. When forward biased, they begin to pass current once their forward voltage is reached. But since no device is ideal, they do exhibit something of a voltage versus current characteristic over a small region. But make no mistake, an LED is NOT a resistor, and the current through it will NOT be directly proportional to the forward voltage applied. Instead, as you increase the applied voltage, the current through the device will start off very near to zero and will stay that way until you reach some threshold. At that point, some conduction will begin, and the current will rise as you increase the forward voltage. But even this will not be a linear curve. These multi-LED modules exhibit a more forgiving voltage versus forward current curve than a single LED might, but still, you need to treat them like what they are, which is an array of LEDs connected in series or series parallel in the case of larger modules. I don't know what the forward voltage rating is for each of the individual LEDs used in these modules, but typical blue LEDs have a forward voltage drop of something like 3.2 Volts when driven with a reasonable forward current. Further, high power LEDs are typically driven at 350mA or less to achieve the best luminous efficacy. These modules appear to contain 100 individual LEDs. If we go with 3.2V (which is nothing more than a guess since the LEDs in these modules could well be a completely different type), and we assume a forward voltage of 30-34 Volts for these modules, and we decide that there's 100 individual LEDs in the module, we come up with approximately 10 LEDs in series to get the 32 Volts. So the modules could contain ten strings of 10 LEDs each. 10 LEDs in series in each string, with ten of those strings connected in parallel to form the array of 100 LEDs. This would give us the 30-34 Volts that the manufacturer states. And close inspection of one of the modules seems to show ten strings of ten LEDs. If you look closely, you can see tiny lead bonds along opposite sides of the power connections. And between the LEDs, there appear to be bond wires connecting the individual dice in series to form the strings of ten LEDs each. So it's a reasonable guess that what we have are ten strings of ten LEDs. And I don't see any kind of resistors in the module. That doesn't mean that there couldn't be any, perhaps included to help balance the current through the ten strings. So-called \"sharing resistors\". But such resistors would also reduce the efficiency of the system, so perhaps they're not needed as long as the LED dice are fairly well matched and kept at the same temperature. And that brings me to a major point about why you don't want to simply drive one of these modules with a constant voltage. The forward voltage drop across an LED (any diode, really) changes with temperature. Indeed, one way of measuring temperature is to simply pass a known current through a diode and measure the forward voltage drop. This is used inside some CPU chips for the on-chip temperature monitoring, etc. So, since the forward voltage drop of an LED is temperature dependent, it makes sense that we'll never know how much current we're forcing through the LEDs if we apply a regulated voltage and ignore everything else - unless we're prepared to regulate the temperature of the LED dice! Sounds like a pain to me. So the traditional (and proper) way to drive an LED is to regulate the CURRENT through the LED. Normally we start with a power source that can provide a voltage somewhat higher than the highest voltage we expect the LED to require. Then we design in an active current regulation system OR simply install a series resistor to limit the current to the approximate value we want. Again, using a resistor to limit the current is somewhat inefficient. That didn't matter much when we were simply driving a low-power LED display from, say, a 5 Volt source. We'd just put in current limiting resistors that kept the LED current to the desired range, and didn't worry too much about the waste. But in the case of a high power LED, we're obviously somewhat concerned with efficiency or we wouldn't be messing with an LED to begin with. So the usual way this is done in commercial LED lighting is to use a switching regulator circuit designed to provide a set current to whatever the load is. This way, the LEDs can change their forward voltage drop with temperature, and we don't care because the current regulator holds the forward current constant. And this is what we really want to do with these LED modules, too. I'm not saying you can't get away with experimenting with them using nothing more than an adjustable voltage power supply, as long as you're careful. And indeed, over a reasonable range of voltages, these modules seem to be quite forgiving. BUT, we need to keep in mind that simply finding a voltage that seems to work for us under one set of conditions on our bench, isn't a substitute for actually regulating the current through the modules. What if you come up with a voltage that gives you the desired (maximum) current of 3.5 Amps through the module. And you build a light based on that. Then you take it out, and the temperature isn't the same as it was on the bench? What if the forward voltage drops of the LEDs go down a bit? Now, your chosen voltage may be forcing far too much current through the LED module, and you may fry it. Or the opposite could be true, and the forward voltage of the LEDs might go up. In that case, if it goes up enough, the light output might drop off to virtually nothing because the current dropped down to some very low value - all simply because the temperature of your LED module wasn't the same as it happened to be when you were experimenting on the bench. I see that Amazon shows their \"folks who bought this often also bought this other thing\", and that indicates that a lot of people are buying, to go with this LED module, a particular step-up voltage converter module with only voltage regulation. So I have to think that a lot of people (like me) envision running these LEDs from a 12 Volt power source, like a sealed lead acid battery or maybe a car power system. And again, we may get away with doing that using only the voltage regulated step-up module. But be advised that you are not really building a reliable design if you do that. The pros would use a step-up module that can provide a voltage above the 34 volts, and which has the ability to limit its output current to the desired level. The website for the LED maker shows a forward current of 3500mA (3.5 Amps) for these units. Ideally, we'll get or build a step-up converter that can be adjusted to, say, 36 Volts output, and then set the current limit to 3.5 Amps. (Assuming we want the full 100 Watt power to the LED module). That way, over a reasonable range of temperatures, our LEDs will receive the correct drive current. If we want them to run dimmer, and save power, we can simply turn down the current limit on the power supply. I do see some constant voltage, constant current modules for sale, too. They cost more, of course, but that's what we really need to properly drive these LEDs. Sorry for the long reply, but based on what I see, a LOT of people seem to think that LEDs require a constant voltage drive. That's not the case. We want a constant current drive, and let the voltage be whatever it will be at that current and temperature. The manufacturer states the typical forward voltage drop for the module so we'll know that our LED power supply must provide AT LEAST that much voltage to the LED module. But I'm sure they assume we'll all use a proper current-limited supply or a series resistor to limit the current to a safe and more-or-less constant current."

        "answer": "There is overspray with any airless sprayer. How much preparation and shielding will depend on your experience with a sprayer. I've been using airless spray guns for 25 years. I haven't purchased one of these yet, but I'm sure it has a different feel than a regular spray gun since you'll be holding a much bulkier unit in your hand. Drop cloths, painter's plastic, cardboard and spray shields are always a painter's friend. I can use an airless sprayer and shooting ceilings and only get 1/2\" to 1\" of overspray around the top of the walls - but that's because I can hold my gun at an angle that allows me better aim - this unit I'm sure would create a much larger spray pattern in ceiling-wall corners."

I know others who have the 30 and 40 series versions. This filter compared to those others is top of line. I am extremely happy I have and am using this filter. I have a 24 ft round - 52 \" wall pool and this filter is more than adaquate to handle the size of my pool. I dont know what your issue is with the clamp on top, but as long as you follow the directions for tightening the band up, you should be fine. Tip- I use a rachet set with a deep bit to loosing and tighten the clamp. Open end adjustible wrenches will strip the band belt bolt."

        "answer": "I used it on some interior detailed brass statues They look great, and I expect the Brass Lacquer will preserve there brilliance for many years. I have a Copula on top of my Garage with a copper roof an a copper flying Goose weather vein on top. I haven't properly lacquered the roof yet but I did bring in the Goose & cleaned it very good & applied 2 coats of the Lacquer in October 2013 an it still looks great. It was the first time I had even thought about a protective coating to show off the copper finish. It seems a shame people purchase cooper or brass decorative outside attachments for their homes, as myself, and feel it the norm to let them fade to Patina (oxidation). When you can coat it and keep the cooper or brass luster you bought it for. I can't wait to Lacquer the Cupola roof. Longevity is a question an abuse from the elements, but for as good as it looks, it seems worth putting on the Spring Clean-up list. Hope this helps. Ya can't loose by trying. A proper cleaning & prep is the key before applying."

        "answer": "This outlet set, I believe, meets UL standards. More importantly, most local and state building codes forbid non Romex type power lines running behind wallboards , ie through the walls. The Arlington box is one of several devices that meet this standard. I used 14 g Romex to connect the outlets with the external line cord. I could then plug it into a surge suppressor for safety. In addition I added 2.5 Carlon tubing (Smurf Tubing) in order to fascilitate feeding the low voltage cables. This is additional fire safety, but more importantly facilitated threading all the cables through the wall and allows removal and replacement in the future. The boxes are well designed, are rugged and tolerate a lot of pulling and tugging. They are recessed and allow the plugs to recess so the TV will mount close to the wall. The plastic/ rubber dampers also allow easy threading of lines while blocking air leaks. This is very important if your walls have outside exposure as through the attic, etc. The building code might make for a violation when getting inspections for mortgages or when selling the home. True a fire would probably be bad if out of compliance."

I have a Delta planer, joiner, and Unisaw. I like them but can't get service. Even letters to the company president were never answered. Go with General. You will be happier. Capn John"

        "answer": "As Krylon Fusion is advertised as \"Bonds to Plastic\" and \"The no-prep, superbond paint for Plastic\", I'd guess that it should work well on 'plastic drums' used for outdoor garden planters. I used Krylon Fusion to paint Trangia (polythene) fuel bottles (originally red) with green Fusion paint, even after online research told me \"paint would not stick to polythene.\" I wanted to visually distinguish 'alcohol fuel bottles' from 'coleman fuel bottles'. Due to the polythene material, I allowed a longer (overnight) drying time, and applied two coats. I've been very pleased and impressed with the results, and the paint seems to be fairly resistant to fuel that spills onto the paint. I don't know your plastic drum composition, but I'd guess Krylon Fusion should work pretty well for your use and outdoor environment."

        "answer": "The only tool you need in order to install this knob set is a Phillips head screwdriver (probably a #2 size). If you are replacing an existing knob set, then you'll also need tools to remove the old one. I was replacing a 25-year old Kwikset knob set, and all it required was the same screwdriver to remove it. On the other hand, if you are installing this knob set on a new door (that's never had a knob set installed), then you will need a number of other tools (hole saw, chisel, drill, etc.) to do the new installation. I bought three of these to replace three existing knob sets; it took less than two hours to do all three. Two of mine had matching keys; I re-keyed the third one to use their key, so I only have to keep up with one key as my knob lock key. It doesn't require much strength to remove or install these, so any adult should have no problem. If you find that you want to invert the key cylinder position, look on YouTube for a video that shows how to do it."

However, long-term solution to this problem involves purchasing 2 (two) rechargeable 3.7V & 6000mAh; Li-ion protected with PCB (model #: 26650 &#8776; $16.00 for a pair). Of course, the final step in circumventing this problem is purchasing a recharging unit (the unit made by 4Sevens recharges a single battery in &#8776; 1 hour).

This light kills bacteria and viruses that pass through air system. This especially important during the summer if you have central air. There is water (sitting in the dark) in the evaporated air conditioning coil area that breeds bacteria and viruses. It is not that expensive and can be installed easily. Once installed the bulb is easy to change when it burns out over time. Unless you are very handy.... I suggest you have a professional heating and air tech install the humidifier and/or the ultraviolet light. One more thing... should you install the humidifier, remember that the filter pad is held in a plastic cage and the replacement pad is separate from the plastic cage. I accidentally threw out the pad with the cage... thinking it was one piece. Unfortunately, that plastic cage is almost as expensive as buying a new unit. I learned the hard way!"

It took me about a half day to figure the thing out. 2. Be careful with the wire that comes with the unit. It's aluminum or something, and breaks VERY easily.

        "answer": "Yes it only goes on with the fan running.... providing you install a \"sail\" switch in the return duct. The unit I purchased had the sail switch included. It should provide enough moisture for all 4 zones but, look on the specs for the square footage. I believe it should give the square foot capacity. It is important to note that you will need a cold water line connected to the unit and that this unit incorporates a low voltage solenoid valve that requires an 110v ac outlet for the transformer to plug into. This unit works great and it also comes with a humidistat that must be installed in the return duct or in a main room. I also installed a UV light from Honeywell that kills airborne germs and virus. These are available on Amazon and are easily installed. Also one more thing.... do not throw away a used humidifier pad with the cage that holds it. The cage is separate from the pad. I made this mistake and I had to purchase another one.... which was very expensive. One more thing I forgot to mention.... you will need a place to drain the water from the unit as it is working. This could be a floor drain, sump pump, or possibly a sink. Good luck!"

A face mount hinge is screwed into the cabinet frame and the inside of the cabinet door, so that only part of the hinge is visible when the door is closed. I needed this type of hinge because it was the same as the previous hinges and the holes were in the cabinets. Additionally, the thickness of the door must be considered in measuring for either type. This photo of the hinge is one dimensional and does not portray the depth of the hinge, that is, the part that will be flush against the cabinet door edge. Not simple to clearly explain! A picture is worth a thousand words. I suggest Googling both kinds of hinges and/or visiting a hardware store to take a look. Come back here to purchase - better prices! Good luck!"

To my surprise, the disc was included with the flush valve that I purchased, so I cancelled the order for the \"little white disc,\" which supposedly would not arrive for at least a month. It turns out, however, that I was able to use a wide putty knife, which turned out to be precisely the same width as the throat of the flush value, to rotate and remove/replace the flush values, without even using the little white disc.

As David, says it will actually fill the exposed grain in wood (previously finished) with continued applications - I have done that same thing on an oak desk surface... My son said he waxes the windshield on his pickup truck and remarks how it will shed rain water and windshield wipers are much more effective - not greasy like the the other rain 'proofer'. I tried it as a weather proofer on some new leather boots....they remained darker due to the 'wetting' of this wax so as the manufacturer says - try it inconspicuously first. One more bourbon and I'm ready to try it on a biscuit too! \"Cracking wax, Gromit!\""

        "answer": "The internal surface of the boiler is one of the stainless steel alloys, I believe that this is true regardless of external finish which is a painted white in my case. I don't know/remember the listed wattage of the unit which is mostly the heater but includes the condensing fan also. The unit can be plugged into a standard 15amp outlet but there should be no other high current devices on that circuit at the same time. I fill mine with hot water to reduce the cycle time and hot water won't have chlorine and has less oxygen in it than city water, so this should help reduce any corrosion. It is possible to do three runs during most people's awake time, but that is about it in my experience."

        "question": "Is this mask effective against smoke from wildfires (in surrounding cities, not fighting the fire)? How about use while spray painting? Thanks!!",
        "answer": "SMOKE: This mask is made to protect you from particulate such as airborne dirt, drywall dust, or smoke or paint particles. It cannot protect you from the poisonous gases contained in smoke, such as odorless carbon monoxide. If you are in a nearby city, as you say, you should be just fine, since the poisonous gasses will be heavily diluted by fresh air and the particulate is filtered out by the mask. Smokejumpers often go in with oxygen tanks strapped on, but forest fire smoke is not nearly as nasty as most paint fumes. PAINT FUMES: I've used these masks for sanding and painting on 3 cars and a rototiller, but remember: these masks cannot protect you from dangerous fumes in a non-ventilated paint shop. They stop solid particles, but not poisonous gasses. Professional paint shops use far more sophisticated equipment, such as air scrubbers and circulation fans, to make the air safe. So, a summary: Wear this mask for the particulate protection, and always keep your face UPWIND of paint fumes. They are great masks, and far better than any cheap mask. These would even be useful if there were a volcanic eruption in the Pacific and all that dust wafted across the US for weeks afterward, which it would. If you wear no mask for drywall sanding, you are BEGGING to get particulate into your lungs where you could wind up in the hospital with bronchitis or worse. Don't ask me how I know that. I won't even buy cheap masks now. /tvg"

        "question": "The existing holes on my door are 8-1/2\" apart. Will this door handle fit those holes?",
        "answer": "Asiago, I'm assuming you mean the holes that the existing handset and deadbolt are mounted in, so the answer would be yes. The handle itself uses one of the holes, usually the lower door hole, for the internal latching mechanism actuated by the thumb. The bottom of the handle is attached and stabilized by a large wood screw. Your deadbolt will generally occupy the other large hole, usually the upper hole. If you use the Camelot digital lock for your deadbolt, vice the handle style shown, it will only require a few inches of clearance between the bottom of the deadbolt digital keypad and the top of the door handle bezel, so it sounds like you should have plenty of clearance. One discovery I made (in going from an older Kwikset lockset to the Schlage) was that I needed to enlarge the holes about another quarter inch to accommodate the larger Schlage handset and deadbolt, but that is no big deal if you have a hole saw. The job is a whole lot easier if you have a locksmith's jig, but easy enough to hand-hold if you have to. Caution - if you hand-hold, be very careful and don't let the saw get away from you when it bites into the wood, as it will \"take off,\" and could really damage the exterior of your door, so go lightly and hold on tightly. Important - I recommend using the fastest drill motor speed and a light touch when sawing, as it tends to be MUCH more difficult if you try to use the variable-speed drill at a lower speed. Good luck!"

It blends in well, but doesn't look as good as having the exact edge piece that was originally connected to that main piece. We bought 200 sq. feet and it covers a 20'x10' area in our basement. More coverage than I had expected. I have no regrets - it's awesome! In fact our basement has flooded twice and the mats did not get ruined.
