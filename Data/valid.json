It's antennas within the meter case are simply responding to the measured magnetic, electric, and radio wave(microwave) energy present at the location of the meter.

The meters contain a simple 9 volt battery in them to power the meters, but this is of no consequence whatsoever."

This is ment more for straight edge work or to dig a chennel down a small board like a router, they are quite different but I guess there use can overlap just a bit. It works by picking the bit you want (for the edge shape or chennel you want) then running the wood across to get the end product. As with all these Dremel accessories (which this is no exception too,) there very plastic and meant only for very light work. I have both this and the \"workstation\" and was dissapointed in how weak they really are, though they do work on small projects. My #1 issue with the \"Shaper/Router Table\" is that when making a small chennel down the inner side of a door trim board the guide would not hold and slip thus making the chennel go off to one side, had to catch it, re-align and tighten again, ended up with pretty messy work for a pretty light job. The workstation would not have worked at all for this purpose."

Unlike higher priced sound level meters, this Wensn SLM's calibration screw is very sensitive; small rotation angles cause large changes to the calibration, so be careful and double-check your adjustment. Obviously you will need either a precision calibrator or, less reliably, an already calibrated SLM to compare sound levels to. I've checked two new Wensn SLMs when first purchased and they both were within the advertised calibration range, at least for the 1000 Hz frequency that most calibrators generate.

But the reason that they do that is that the cheapy connectors that are so popular in the home stores are the crappy 1/4\" ones. I throw those in the garbage and use the larger 3/8\" connectors. My air tools, especially the rotary ones, are much happier with the larger connectors. In fact, the documentation with some of them require at least a 3/8\" air flow path to achieve the designed performance. Using 1/4\" fittings would have crippled those tools. That said, this hose should be fine for low air consumption devices like nailers, etc... Just beware..."

According to the user documentation for this model (the documentation can be found under the \"Download\" tab on the http://www.firstalert.com/component/flexicontent/45-battery/288-battery-operated-carbon-monoxide-alarm web page), the CO detector can be installed \"In Mobile Homes: Install CO Alarms on inside walls ONLY. Uninsulated outside walls and roofs of mobile homes often transfer heat and cold from outdoors. The Alarm should be located at least 6 inches (152 mm) from all exterior walls and at least 12 inches (305 mm) from supply or return vents.\" (I realize a mobile home is not an RV but the above information should be useful in determining if there is a place available given the above requirements.) The document also lists where co alarms should not be installed: \"DO NOT LOCATE THIS CO ALARM: * In garages, kitchens, furnace rooms, or in any extremely dusty, dirty or greasy areas. * Closer than 20 feet (6 meters) from a furnace or other fuel burning heat source, or fuel burning appliances like a water heater. * Within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of any cooking appliance. * In extremely humid areas. This alarm should be at least 10 feet (3 meters) from a bath or shower, sauna, humidifier, vaporizer, dishwasher, laundry room, utility room or other source of high humidity. * In areas where temperature is colder than 40 F (4.4 C) or hotter than 100 F (37.8 C). These areas include unconditioned crawl spaces, unfinished attics, uninsulated or poorly insulated ceilings, porches, and garages. * In turbulent air, like near ceiling fans, heat vents, air conditioners, fresh air returns, or open windows. Blowing air may prevent CO from reaching the sensors. * Outside the Mobile Home. * In direct sunlight.\" I hope this helps."

It takes 8 hours to fully cure. In my opinion it would seal a barrel, however, I think the wood on the barrel will slowly wick the water through. Also, the material you are applying the foam to must be clean and dry. Most times when a barrel is used it has a preformed liner in it. Perhaps try a small piece of pond liner? I hope it helps.

        "answer": "I just measured the \"nail \" part and it is a rather large .345\" as measured with a very accurate electronic caliper. If the chair or table legs you are wanting to nail them into is less than about 1\" diameter, you will risk splitting the leg. I know, I speak from experience. The one good thing is that with the \"nail\" being so large in diameter, it won't bend even in tough wood. They are also rather sturdy by comparison with other products. For thinner chair legs that need a more conventional nail that is only about 1/16th inch diameter, you might try Mintcraft FE-50320 Plastic/Felt Glides. I have also tried these. Buy extra of them though as some of them fell apart while nailing them in place, and they bend readily. One has to nail them very square with the head of the hammer, and be very gentle. They are a bit cheaply made. I had better quality with ones I bought at Home Depot or my local hardware store."

        "answer": "Our experience is YES, the Stiebel Eltron Tempra 24 Plus will supply enough hot water to draw baths (or showers) for two people simultaneously. The unit is rated as a \"whole house\" tankless water heater for a two bedroom house or condo, but two simultaneously open hot water taps basically reaches the production capacity of the unit (about the same as a 40-50 gallon conventional tank water heater). There are many variables...the efficiency/production of the unit depends upon the temperature (coldness) of the incoming supply. If your tap water is at 35-40F, then the unit will not produce as much hot water flow as it would, if your incoming tap water supply was at 50F, as it takes the two little \"boilers\" inside the unit longer to heat very cold tap water to the set temperature and the \"flow\"/volume of hot water is \"reduced\" accordingly. The temperature that you set the unit at is also a factor...if the unit is set \"low\" at say 105F then the effect will be that you will seem to not have as much hot water, because you will not be mixing in very much cold water at your bath spigot or your shower head. We set our unit at 126F, because our dishwasher recommends an incoming hot water supply of 125F, and this works out well for us. We are just two people in a two bedroom house and this unit is sized perfectly for us and always delivers and supplies our hot water demands, plus the hot water flow is \"endless\", as the unit will continuously heat water to the set temperature as it flows through it...one can wash load after load of clothes in hot water, or a football team could take showers one after another and there would always be hot water. Plus, the unit very, very efficiently uses electricity to heat water, much more efficiently than a conventional tank-type electric water heater."

A 12 volt bulb would not cause any danger of electrocution so try it! I would! If the bulb is visibly exposed, consider the Warm White Light Bulb instead of the High Power White LED Bulb. Both kinds put out about the same amount of light, an amazing amount of light considering the low power draw. I am super pleased with these bulbs and I certainly would put them in outdoor lighting. On the box they claim the bulbs will last up to 100,000 hours. That is 11.4 years if my math is correct. I hope this was helpful. Alfred Thorsberg."

I followed the prep instructions to the letter. Long story short when the last coat went on it looked really good, but then thousands of, what appeared to be tiny air bubbles started appearing all over the surface. I let it cure and then tried to knock down the roughness and reapply a a third coat. It looked good, but then spiderweb type cracks started appearing all over the surface.

        "answer": "Hi: I bought the pump to use with an HO scale river lock on my layout. It seemed to work fine at first when I was testing things. I was able to pump about 1 quart every minute which was fine. When I put it all together the pump would work fine for a minute or so then stop or slow to just a trickle. New batteries did not help. I did not think of the back pressure and that could be my problem. I replaced it with a small pond pump. Good luck. Steve"

If it pulls more than 20 amps you could trip a circuit breaker depending on the load rating of the breaker. I've run my AC on this adapter but the circuit I connected to had a 30 amp rating. When I tried to operate the AC on a 20 amp circuit, it would trip the breaker."

        "question": "Glenn wants to know if it really worth it. Or should I make my own",
        "answer": "-&gt; You will need to either carry or purify one gallon per person per day (Red Cross, CDC, FEMA)&lt;- I have looked at this kit in detail, and I think it makes a fair car kit or a one day bag, but for a true 72 hour kit you will need more water and tarp than this. I did not buy this kit, so I can't comment on quality, but the list of items is a good start. I especially like the addition of the contagion masks. These are cheap and you should have one a day for each person in your family, for as long as you can. The work gloves are a nice addition, showing that the designers have had enough bushcraft blisters to give this kit some consideration. Having said that: Since this product has (a little) water and some work gloves and bushcraft items, I assume it is intended to be used outside your home environment (\"bug out\"). First, a word about bags themselves: IMHO this bag is not optimized for an offsite recovery attempt. If you are going to be away from home, it will most likely be in a FEMA camp of other storm shelter; your family will be best served by preparing a backpack for each person that can carry one. Bags must only be DRAB colors, and should NOT say emergency or supplies anywhere on them. A bright red bag that says \"supplies\" makes your loved one a target. Next, what to put in your drab backpack: Many good bug-out packing lists (Red Cross, NOAA, CDC, FEMA, various survival blogs) are available on line. No single bag can hold all your family will need for three days in a shelter. Make a pack for everyone that looks like a regular, lightly worn, everyday backpack. I would suggest that the smaller items like toilet paper, extra plastic baggies and very light things are carried by the children. Toilet paper is nearly weightless and has colossal bartering value. A word about redundant supplies; put lots of TP, sporks, zip strips, twist ties, toothbrush, earplugs, insect stick, chapstick, sunscreen, band aids, and the like in each bag, in case one is stolen or lost. Adults should generally carry heavier (most of the water) items, and SOS, Millennium, or equivalent food bars. Each bag should have tethered on the outside a very loud whistle, as you might become separated in crowds of evacuees. A crank flashlight, ideally with a USB port, is essential in each bag. I'll leave the rest of the items to your review of online bug-out bag lists. There are hundreds. Pack smart and light. Weight is so important: Take the bags on a yearly hike. Listen for rattling, feel the straps. Can you reach the whistle? Unpack and repack twice a year. Any bag that is too heavy to hold over one's head walking for a full minute is a liability to the wearer. Don't go overboard with big knives and spears and things like that. You won't be walking into the public storm shelter carrying a macho battle axe / flamethrower combo. You will need a small multi tool worn on the belt of each adult. Don't stand out. And for heaven's sake enough with the camo. On the opposite side of the coin: If you plan to recover in place or \"bug in\", you won't be wearing this bag around the house anyway, so it would not be useful. If you are bugging in, the bag is not needed, better to store two (the more the better) weeks of water, one gallon per person per day, and two weeks of dry food as a starting point. The list of bug in materials is extensive. Think power outage, thirsty neighbors. If you plan to ignore an evacuation order, you'll need to be able to black out the windows, and stay indoors for a few weeks at least. Think Katrina. Do yourself a favor, don't ignore evac orders. Have a plan to bug in, and a plan to bug out. The gear is different, but the water and food will be the same. Let's hope we won't need these, and at the same time pack like we know we will."

With this deadbolt, there is no key to put into it, so it doesn't look like any other deadbolt. You must make sure you get the right size, either 60mm or 70mm depending on the type of door you install it into. It was a pain to get the magnet set up in the door frame to make it work correctly. I had to use tape, find the right allignment, chip away and cut wood from the door jamb, use spacers, etc. It's not super pretty, but I could trim it out more and make it look even better but it's in the laundryroom between the laundry and garage so it's not high visibility. As for the lock, I absolutely love it. best lock I've had but I still forget to push the button sometimes even after 6 months plus of owning it."

I actually waited 48 hours, but I had such bad luck with other products before, that I allowed extra time, though I think it would have worked. Also - after I put the epoxy inside the area that broke off, I also sealed it on the outside with the epoxy, to just make sure.

Incidentally, these blades are absolutely fantastic. I use them for trimming trees, cutting up old construction lumber into firewood, and even for cutting holes in sheetrock. The only things these blades do not like to cut is metal nails. They dull quickly when in contact with metal. I am confident you will love these blades. I have six new ones in my garage so that I never run out of these fantastic blades."

It mounts with screws and between mounting it at the angle you want and pivoting it up and down you can aim it where you want it. The installation is an easy job. I bought the 3-pack. I've had them installed for several months. They have worked very well and I'm satisfied with them. My only complaint...and it's a small one...is that once activated the lights only stay on for a short time...maybe 20-30 seconds.

Both are available on Amazon at a good price. the water based system is much easier to apply and to clean up. the expoxy is stronger and better at treating really badly rotted wood. after treating the wood, then the bondo can be used to fill any defects and the nail holes in the siding. note there are two different bondo products, one for just wood and the second for all purpose. both work well for filling holes. it is important to understand that the wood rot needs to be \"hardened\" before filling the defects or the bondo will not stick to the wood. good luck!"

It appears to me that AMAZON no longer carries a 2021BP with the float available on it so I'me not sure, but you could probably make a float similar with a small square or round piece of styrofoam and put a small hole in the middle then push the flapper chain through the hole?"

They are high power batteries that should be charged in a stand-alone charger that \"conditions and maintains\" the battery to prevent premature failure and ensure a proper load. If not charged correctly, these batteries can fail DRAMATICALLY. I use the Xtar VP1 chargers because they bring the battery down to an optimum level before charging them all the way up to the full 4.2 volts. The charger also maintains a steady charge rate and has a digital display of the voltage. Great little charger that protects these very expensive batteries. There are, of course, several other brands/models that also charge and maintain 18650 batteries. The Xtar is just my favorite. I have two Sky Ray Kings and tons of other CR123 and 18650 battery operated lights. Sort of a hobby/addiction/money hole! :)"

And it will cost you hundreds of dollars to connect a 40 dollar light. It just makes no sense. If, as one person observed, perhaps you want to run it off the low voltage of a landscape system then yes, you can do that BUT, the way this particular unit is assembled the batteries are enclosed within the housing of the lamp, so you cannot just connect the wire that is hanging out. You'd have to open the sealed case, de-solder some connections and attach the power wires. It would be simpler and cheaper to just buy a flood light made for your landscape lighting system. They are inexpensive and they are plug and play. Hope that helps you out."

        "answer": "\"Wiped on\" is the only way I use Varathane now. I take a paper towel, dab it into the can, and carefully rub it onto the wood. I just did this with some repurposed cigar boxes the other night - came out beautiful. The finish seams to be a little more satiny than when you brush on the Varathane - the first project I did, I brushed on many coats and the pieces were a bit shiny. I prefer the wiped finish, it looks great on both of the Cigar Box Guitars that I've built and, as I mentioned, the two cigar boxes I just redid. You want to avoid putting on very thick layers, as well as leaving any gobs or lines of the finish, just like with anything else you're putting on wood. General rule of thumb with this stuff - if it looks white or creamy on the wood, it's too thick. Be careful sanding between layers, since the wiped on finish, for me, is often thinner than brushed on finish. Side note - The guitars only have Varathane on the neck. The wood for the necks came from an old dining room table, it's heavy and dense. The wood was stripped of finish, painted with a variety of colors and chemicals to reach a certain patina, and then I wiped on the Varathane. Came out beautiful, and the finish is holding up really well."

The Federal statute requires the bottom edge of the mailbox door to be no shorter than 41\" from the ground, and no taller than 46\", but in reality that varies by zip code as your local Post Office may request a mailbox to be higher. Ask your mail carrier where they want it and how tall. Overall the length of that post, measuring from the top of the ball finial to the bottom edge of the post is 71\". This is also a Postmaster Approved Mailbox. As for the address numbers, after you place your order you may e-mail us with the numbers you need. If we don't hear from you within 24 hours we will call you to find out what you need. Your mailbox plaque will never be sent without confirmation of the numbers you need.

Just make sure your holes are the right diameter if already drilled because the sprayer requires a larger one than the others and you want to be sure your washer nut is not going to slip through too large a hole.

However, this does not really make a difference because we offer a life-time guarantee on our product excluding batteries. Whether it is brand new or a few years old, we stand behind our product.

If no bulb is present in the connected socket, the switch does not illuminate. If a incandescent bulb is installed, the switch illuminates, and the small electric current is not visible in the light bulb. If an LED bulb is installed, the switch illuminates or pulses, and the LED bulb flashes due to the small current (charging the capacitor inside the bulb I assume)."

It just says it's compatible. So that means that there is no guarantee the mount will be the same or that he pigtail adapter will be the same, although it could be. It simply means that the 9120B and the 4120B can communicate with each other in an interlinked fashion (one alarm sets off all alarms). I would expect that at most, you would need to change the mount and connect up the new pigtail adapter. Even if it's not \"plug and play\" you should be able to get it to work for you."

The mount is to the rail, and does not attach to the guard, it does come close to the guard but not stabilized. I have the TLR-4 and am quite pleased with it. Only advice (based on previous negative reviews) do not over tighten the rail spring screw, when it is too tight, the polymers can and have cracked. Good luck!"

        "answer": "It is similar to a semi-soft dense foam when dry. Not crumbly. More like firm rubbery spongy. It does not fully \"harden\" like some foams do (probably a built-in safety feature to keep it from over-expanding and busting things like some of the original \"expanding foams\" did). Does not have any real stand-alone structural strength any more than styrofoam let's say, but will fill gaps nicely. If you were using it \"sandwiched\" between two sheets of plywood it would add some structural strength I should think. You may have to trim it around the edges with a razer blade or something similar after it expands and drys. Keep in mind that IT DOES !EXPAND! Your question did not give me a complete visual as to what you are trying to do/accomplish so this is the best answer I can come up with. Sorry."

There are also 5 light settings which can be chosen by turning the light on and \"double clicking\" the on/off button 1. Brightest 2. Mid brightness 3. Dimmest setting 4. Flash 5. SOS. you may have it on the wrong setting. Also, the lense slides in and out. Compressed would be a very wide light, making it dimmer. Sliding the lense out (grand the head and tail ends and pull) gives a more direct and brighter beam of light. Also. Your battery or batteries may be close to dead. Try replacing the batteries or recharging the battery. Again I prefer the rechargeable. Lastly. You may not be charging your battery fully. It must remain on the charger until full. When you place the battery in the charger the indicator light will light up red. When full it will change to green. And depending when the last time the battery was charged will take a long time. I work overnights at work once a month so I charge it before my overnights start. When the week is over I don't charge it till the next month. I have had it take 24 hours to fully charge. But that's my doing. I'm sure if you charged it once a week or so it probably won't take as long. I hope this helps. I spent $40 on this light and it's the best $40 I ever spent. I dropped the light in a pond and dropped it from 150ft+ in the air and it still works as new. Very tough and reliable light. Like I said. Hope this helps"

It is almost impervious to hot water, and most chemicals (except very harsh acids) because, it's like plastic once its layered on for a long time. One suggestion I got that really worked on ceramic wall tile (I was cleaning up a dirty rental apt), which not involve burning my lungs with acid vapor in a confined shower space, was to simply physically remove the scum with a razor blade paint scraper. It's the ones people use to remove stickers from windows, etc. You can buy them at hardware stores or dollar stores. (Always be careful and remember where your fingers are while working with a razor!). Firmly and steadily shave/scrape down then across the surface of the dry tiles and you will see many layers of soap scum residue come cascading off (like a powder). You can rinse it all down the drain if you like. Then use the steamer to finish off the remaining residue, then maybe use windex to remove all traces of residue. Voila! The next scheduled cleaning with the steamer should be much faster and easier . Tip: After the tile is all squeeky clean and looks as new, try rubbing it with some Turtle Wax to inhibit build-up till the next regular cleaning."

I initially used some GE CFL's (I don't know the model, but they were flood-type bulbs). The first few nights when the motion lights were activated they CFL's would come on, but on the 3rd or 4th night when they were activated they would turn on, but the CFL's were giving off a weird color and were only about half as bright as they were the first two nights. If I turned the motion lights to a constant \"on\" state, the CFL's would then eventually brighten and the color would return, but never 100% as on the first few nights. This happened with all 4 bulbs I was using. I returned them and replaced them with incandescent 100w floodlights after that, so I don't have any long term experience with them."

        "answer": "Whether target concrete is raised as a step or slab excavation, drilling and chiseling will get the job done. My following note addresses slab excavation. By drilling an outline of area to be removed - say 1\" to 2\" apart using a smallish ( I used 1/2\" SDS ) drill bit - your concrete will crumble when hammered with a chisel bit - I used 3/4\" wide Viper chisel ). Removal of about .5 sq.foot took maybe 1/2 hr. You are removing about 3 times as much material but I'm sure you will excavate at a faster rate as you learn how your tool operates. Apart from perforating the concrete ( avoids cracks outside removal zone ), a sledge hammer helps greatly when broken concrete lumps lock up on each other. Good Luck !"

The light is nice, but if you can 'see' the bulbs, they do have some glare to them as they are clear, not frosted. If you are just looking for something that will give nice ambient lighting, you should be fine with them, though. I ended up using these in open, recessed can fixtures above our downstairs bar and they are fine there - but I don't need a bright light in that location. Also - these are NOT dimmable, so if the lamp has a 3-way switch, you may want to look at other options. Hope that helps!"

I have our pump set for 40 (lower) to 60 (upper) psi water pressure. I'm perfectly happy with the performance of the Speakman at this pressure, and I never removed the restrictor."

The bottom of that 2x3 tube has 1/4 inch tapped holes so that you can bolt the tube to the angle bracket after it has been attached to the edge of the table saw. The process I am trying to explain is reall pretty simple, and once you see the parts, the chances are pretty good it will make sense as to how it works. Once the 2x3 is attached to the saw, the fence is dropped in place, and a \"test cut\" should be made to check how parallel your Biesemeyer fence is with the saw's blade, it is not difficult to adjust the fence."

I would not set them in the coals. remember to keep the food at a hard boil for 10 min. now the 5.5 l is a smaller pot and will keep food at temp for about 8h, nine or 10 and you will need to re heat your food to a boil. just did a 12 day camping trip on the great river road by way, had only one instance where we had to re-heat. i had no problem with food not being cooked. if you put food in the smaller pot, you do need to put boiling water in the bottom pot just for the thermal mass. the 2 pots nest into each other, so you only need 1 lid on the top smaller pot. the out most layer is just a huge thermos insulated very well, and not meant for cooking in."

        "answer": "Yes and No.The higher the Merv rating, the more strain you will put on your furnace/blower. The more denser (Higher Merv rating) the filter, the more your blower motor will have to work. Of course, you will pull out more particles/dust/pollen etc out of the air, with a higher Merv rating. I have a variable speed blower motor/fan, so my Hvac technician can adjust my blower/fan speed. For my house, approx. 1600 sq ft, I found the Filtrate 1000 (Approx Merv rating of 11) to be ideal, with my two cats. I also buy charcoal pre filters here on Amazon and use them with my filter. They also tend to pick up a lot of stuff out of the air. I then vacume both the filter and pre filter (with a Hepa vacume cleaner) at least twice a month. I then change my furnace filter every 4 to 6 weeks-even though the filters would be good for at least 90 days. This may be considered excessive but my Hvac tech states my coils are always clean and the house is cool/warm when I want it. Next time your Hvac tech is at your house and servicing your system, ask him/her what they recommend."

That is , if for example your ramps are outside and near traffic you will be measuring those sounds as well as any talking, shouting or music. These are sensitive and 'relatively' accurate - give the device a few seconds to 'settle down' / stabilize after turning it on. Expect wide fluctuations in your readings consistent with the actual sound levels the device is detecting. I've seen reviewers of various devices declare the devices as inaccurate because the readings were erratic when in fact the devices are merely 'reporting' exactly what they are 'hearing'... In a very quiet indoor setting I have seen this device show minor fluctuations from the loud ticking of a clock or traffic outside on a residential street 100-200 yards away. I use my device in a controlled - relatively sound proof music studio where its sensitivity and relative accuracy make it a perfect device for my application. Good Luck!!!"

The center is a metalic silver'ish color but it would certainly be easy enough to spray paint black, if that's what you prefer. You could paint only that piece before putting it together. And, it's very simple to install! I really like the one we purchased and it's working perfectly! Hope that helped."

        "question": "Can a dimmer switch be used to control the speed of this fan?",
        "answer": "No, a simple dimmer switch cannot be used and will burn out the motor. Simple dimmers reduce the voltage; this model uses an AC motor. That means that the running speed of the motor depends on the line frequency (60 Hz in the USA). If you reduce the voltage, the speed will not decrease because the line frequency is still 60 Hz; the wall dimmer has no effect on frequency. What will happen is that the motor will \"try\" to continue to run a the same rpm (about 850 for this model), and will draw more current to make up for the reduced voltage from the dimmer. Increased current will cause the motor to overheat and burn out. If you want a variable speed fan, you need one with a DC motor. Panasonic has several, you would have to look at them - but I am not sure Panasonic offers a DC version at this high flow rating. Sorry this may not be what you want to hear, but that's the deal."

Please be absolutely aware of chemical toxins and biological pathogens that your lab will be able to identify. On a final note depending on you geographical location, we need to also be concerned about radiological contamination. To some extent there is a filter that is capable of addressing that problem too.

        "question": "Can I plug an extension cord into this control to operate 2 utility pumps or this control limits to one pump operation only?",
        "answer": "Answer is \"Maybe\" You have to look at the pumps' specs and add their amp draws. If one pump says, let's say 4.5 A, and the other 5.5, then the collective draw is 10. Glentronics switch allows for up to 12 Amps, so you would be OK there. Most average pumps, even two at a time, will probably draw under 12 amps, so you may be OK. Check the pumps' specs carefully though. But, if you ask Glentronics directly, they may say \"no\". The switch was UL tested to operate with one pump only, I'm sure. Running two pumps, while technically may be OK, will probably void the switch warranty and give the insurance company a reason to deny your claim. For the installation to be proper, the permanently installed pump should be connected to a dedicated breaker and be GFCI-protected, either by the breaker or by GFCI receptacle that the switch/pump plug into, and it should be just one pump. To sum up. If you plug an extension cord into the switch, will the world end? Probably not. But it is jury rigging at best. Besides, most extension cords are not meant to be installed in wet locations, and none are meant to replace permanent wiring."

That means the noise doesn't damage your hearing and - since you can hear the cars coming - that some texting driver doesn't damage you."

        "answer": "This post might help: http://jmbldwn.com/post/13265831545/got-my-nest-thermostat-working Basically, you break the circuit going to your heater on the red wire and insert the relay in between. The red wire on the relay goes to the heater. The blue wire goes to the line (source) side. The black wire connects to the other line (black). Since 220v circuits are symmetric, you could break the circuit on the black, but this way black connects to black and red connects to red. The only color that doesn't connect to its own is blue, which connects to the line side red. If you get it backwards, you'll know because you won't be getting 24v out of the relay that is supposed to power your Nest. The relay has a small transformer inside that converts 240v to 24v, and it needs the high voltage to be on the blue and black wires. Good luck. Of course, if you're not sure, get a licensed electrician!"

Examples include T30, T27, T25, etc. They come in standard TORX sizes without the center hole or security TORX with the center hole. If you don't need these elongated versions, Craftsman makes just the short bit set that also includes a bunch of other security bit types. I bought my set years ago. It includes 32 different type bits pushed into a red rubber holder. The size is 2 1/2\" x 1 3/8\" x 1 7/8\" tall with the bits installed in the rubber holder. I highly recommend it for keeping them all together in a small space. Unless you need the long ones, stick with my suggestion or find something other than the one brand that I evaluated as totally defective. From here your on your own in that I have not had time to order from any other supplier. Just too many projects going on at once lately. Good Luck and Happy Hunting."

All it does it keep the pipes above freezing. that's the reason you have to cover the tape with foam wraping, to hold the small amount of resistance heat next to the pipes and not let too much free air get to the tapes. I leave mine on all winter and our electric bill has not risen at all and we've had temperatures in the low teens. Depending on where your from, that many not be much but I really don't care as I don't have to spend the money to dig up frozen pipes to fix them."

When operating a drum with a sponge like material would pass through the trough, picking up water which would infiltrate the hot air of the was producing, thus increasing the house humidity. Problem was, many times water in trough would build up with minerals, the sponge like material would clog not picking up water, and I heard that the trough water would stagnate, possibility causing health problems. With the pass trough system, the element that delivers water to the air requires cleaning at the beginning of the heating season, that's it, makes life easy.

These have a pinkish light that I haven' seen in an LED yet. If you are worried about power consumption then they are usually a fluorescent type of lamp so are quite low compared to an incandescent lamp."

        "answer": "The measurements are: 5 & 1/2 inches high by 2 & 1/4 inches wide. Of course that does not account for the legs. That is the actual measurement of just the unit that holds the extendable legs. I personally installed this unit on a smaller non-commercial 16' extension ladder where the legs are only 2 & 3/4 inches wide. At minimum, you should be able to install it on ANY ladder that isn't narrower than the unit, so it should fit on any ladder that is at least 2 & 1/4 inches wide. Keeping in mind that if there is a lip or ridge on either side of the ladder leg (like what you find on an extension ladder), you will want to make sure that the measurement is between the ridges of the ladder leg. Realistically, the ladder would have to be very small for the Louisville ladder extender not to fit. If you are using it on a ladder that doesn't have a ridge or lip on the legs, I don't see why the unit couldn't extend slightly beyond the sides of the ladder legs since the unit's bolt holes are closer together than 2 & 1/4 inches"

        "answer": "Function isn't really how one should look at the slim design. Light Emitting Diodes tend to be rather directional in how they emit light. In a typical household current LED bulb the LEDs point away from the socket. Depending on the application this is fine. However, for lamps such as a table lamp, this directionality leaves the light emitting up, but leaves the table the lamp is placed on poorly illuminated. The ring you see on these lamps contains a loop of LEDs. Since the LEDs now face outward from the bulb, instead of upward, they broadcast the light much more like a traditional tungsten element bulb. Behind a translucent lamp shade these bulbs look like a regular frosted bulb. The biggest difference you'll find between these LED bulbs and incandescent ones when illuminated will be heat production."

I have yet to have to replace the batteries on the faucet, and we've had this installed for years. Also, it's a battery pack that you insert a bunch of AAs into, so it isn't hard to replace the batteries when necessary. That said, bypassing the electronics isn't as simple as flipping a switch; it will require reworking a couple of connections under the sink. Maybe a 10-15 minute job for a neophyte like me (pure guesswork given that we haven't had to do it and the initial install took under an hour)."

        "question": "If you put a heavy weight on it, let's say 200 pounds, and you push it, IS THE HANDLE STRONG ENOUGH NOT TO BREAK?",
        "answer": "Yes, the handle is strong enough to not break, at least, in my experience with the Flatform. HOWEVER, you also need to consider the terrain that you're pushing on. If it's gravel or grass or any surface that isn't hard and flat, then you could break the handle because you're exerting much more force to overcome the terrain. Even the threshold of a door can be a problem at times. I've found that pulling through the door is usually better than pushing through, because of the way that the exerted force is transferred through the mass that you're moving (pulling is more efficient and doesn't compromise the handle's mechanism). I've found that lifting the front with my toe is faster and easier than fighting with the cart. Make no mistake: This is NOT a tool for heavy-duty tasks; it is for light-but-unwieldy to moderate weights, in ideal conditions, where storage space for a regular cart isn't practical (like an office). I've learned these things the hard way and yes, my handle is a little wobbly, but I will buy another one! (Hopefully, they'll put a BRAKE on the next model.)"

In my own house, I installed it under the kitchen sink (in series with house hot water heater) to provide nearly instant hot water in the kitchen. Before installation, hot water arrived in about 1.5 minutes, now it arrives in 5 sec. Another use for this heater would be in a small apt or garage where there is only a sink and no shower. This small water heater does a nice job of providing hot water in such a situation. I chose the 4.5 gallon size thinking it would actually fit in the cabinet under the kitchen sink, but there was not enough space. So, I installed it on a small platform below the floor joists in the crawl space. I plumbed it so that I could still run on just the house hot water heater if needed. So far, no problems (6 months)."

A large adjustable wrench and new water heater hose connectors, a phillips screw driver, teflon pipe tape, some 1/2\" PVC (length will depend on where you put the drain), you will need at least a 1/2\" PVC T-fitting and pvc glue. I didn't have a drain nearby, so I ran my pipe under the house and out through the exterior block wall which was quite a bit of work.

The tool often comes with a set of guides that every router user should have anyway. The procedure is straightforward: Setup the base on the router using the alignment tool and accurately mark the locations of the screw holes for the mounting screws. Drill and counterbore the base. Remove the base, alignment tool, and the old base. Mount the new base and you're ready to go. The cautions lie mainly with the accuracy of the screw hole locations. If they are not dead on, you will have problems with everything you do in terms of accuracy and convenience. Good luck."

        "answer": "I believe that will really depend on where your outlet is. Some folks may install or have an outlet right inside the bathroom wall at the back of the cabinet bathroom wall which would hide the cord. Or totally opt using batteries instead cause I didn't have an existing outlet down there and I didn't want to fiddle with installing one which would add more time and effort to do to get the faucet installed and ready to use. Since I have installed using the batteries I haven't had to change them at all yet. And it's still working fine. And should the batteries die, the default setting is shut, not open, so you wouldn't have water running or overflowing. I hope this helps answer your question."

The screws and jig could work if the drilling and pressure would not split the cypress and the expansion and contraction of the wood would not cause cracking over time. Best bet would be to contact Kreg to see if they have any information on using it with cypress. The wood should be excellent (rot resistant), but not sure if it would split."

        "answer": "It should work with a 220 volt system. The back of the device fits over a standard on/off wall light switch and moves it up or down with battery power, not household current. It does not plug in, and there is no electrical connection between the device and your electrical system. I agree with James Carey's comment and disagree with those who say it will not work. The only issue should be the size of your switch, the plastic knob that goes up or down to turn the lights on and off. I am set up on a 120 volt system, so have not personally used it on 240volts. If it does not work for some reason, I have found Amazon to stand behind its products, so would probably be returnable."

        "answer": "If I understand your question there are a couple of ways to do this. Since the timer is going to power the relay there will be no issue with amperage draw. The relay doesn't draw appreciable current, it's just a relay. One way to proceed is to install the timer \"upstream\" of the lighted switch. In this approach you wire the timer into your 12 volt system (remember a fuse or breaker and check the ampacity of the wire) your timer becomes the source of power to the lighted switch and in turn the relay. Of course the heavy load that your relay controls remains wired as it always has been. Should you wish to shut down the heater for a long time you can simply turn off the lighted switch and ignore the timer. A second approach would be to remove the lighted switch entirely and simply use the timer as the power source for your relay. Again just for the switching, not for the load. These timers can be programed but they also have a manual function so you can over ride the programming and turn your heater on manually should you choose."

Also, it DOES have a programable choice to set a Daylight Savings time option. It's a good thermostat... I'm happy that it was this that failed, and NOT a break in the heating elements under the tile!"

I've learned through costly experience that even if the teeth are the much harder material called tungsten carbide (highly unlikely here), they will be destroyed almost instantly by even the softer grades of ceramic tile.The best reliable way to saw ceramic tile is with a diamond grit blade or bur. Diamond blades are readily available at about $30 to fit common inexpensive 4-1/2 inch high speed angle grinders. Small diamond-grit burs to fit Dremel or RotoZip type tools are far less expensive and allow finer control of the cut but they cut much slower and don't last nearly as long. Whatever you do, be SURE to protect your lungs from the tile dust to minimize chances of acquiring the deadly disease called silicosis."

Here's the long answer: I bought two of these fans during construction of our new house and had hoped to run them both off one controller. The electrician who wired the house connected both fans to a \"universal\" fan controller, the kind that fits inside the wall box like a light switch. One fan would work pretty well but the other fan would only jerk as though it were trying to start but couldn't. The electrician then tried a similar controller that was supposed to control multiple fans. They both worked better but made noise. About this time I dug up the instructions for both the fans and the controllers. The fan instructions specifically say \"To reduce the risk of fire or electric shock, do not use this fan with any solid state fan speed control device, or variable speed control\". The controller's instructions said \"CAUTION: To avoid overheating and possible damage to other equipment, do not use to control receptacles, fluorescent lighting fixtures, or transformer-supplied appliances\". We then tried running both fans with one of the supplied transformer type speed controls and that didn't really work either. We finally decided that we don't really mind the \"vintage\" appearance of the supplied controllers. In fact my wife actually likes the way they look. Because they stand out from the wall we mounted them above the switches controlling those circuits (on/off) so they're just above shoulder height and we're less likely to bump into them as we walk down the hall. The fans are great. We still love them and would buy them again. We'd just skip the headache of trying to avoid using the supplied controllers."

Flip over your tank cover and you should see your model number. Listed as part of the product description, here on Amazon, are the Toto toilets that it fits. I do see other Toto fill valves that are listed for one-piece toilets."

If you mean you are just gonna put it on to get a thin layer on all sides of it, I don't think this will be the right product for you. I would go with a spray on poly. This product is a thick, self leveling viscous liquid. It won't stick to the aluminum long enough to dry evenly."

If that isn't the motivation for your question, I see no functional reason to do so. I would suggest that you purchase wire staples large enough to accommodate all the cables you're running in parallel so as to keep them organized. You didn't say if you intended to run it outside where it would be exposed to weather, however this cable is weatherproof as well. Running it inside conduit would certainly increase its resistance to moisture, but it may be overkill. Assuming that you can install conduit with no issues, it certainly will \"pretty up\" multiple cables. Depending on the number of parallel runs you intend, it may be a bit challenging to get them all snaked through the conduit. You'll likely need to pull them all at once. I hope that helps. If not, I'll address any additional questions you may have."

There are two doors on this box: the locked bottom compartment, and the unlocked hinged top door (it's the section on the pic of the box where \"U.S. MAIL\" is written. The postal worker opens the top unlocked door, and tosses the mail in where it falls into the locked compartment. There is a large clip visible right behind the top unlocked door panel for OUTGOING mail to be wedged under . With the red flag out (and especially if mail is being delivered) the postal worker will easily see it. Again, no one including the mail carrier, will need a key to get your outgoing mail, assuming it fits in the top compartment where the letter clip is. However, since no one will need a key to access your outgoing mail, ANYONE can get to your outgoing mail (but this is the case for most private mailboxes). My only issue with this mailbox is that it seems to attract a lot of bills, but I'm shopping around for a filter for this problem."

I have found it accurate at reading capacitance, taking a few seconds to read the mfd. One of my techs had the Fieldpiece multi meter. I like the UEI model better than Fieldpiece since I don't have to switch heads to read Amps and then volts. I can do either or both very easily.

        "answer": "Since the outside cutters are beveled, and protrude slightly above the flat raker teeth on the inside cutters by design, it's simply not possible for this set to cut \"perfectly\" flat dados. It's designed that way to reduce tear out on cross grain cuts....it's the same principle that many ATB ground blades use to reduce tear out. The good news is that the bat ears are reasonably small....they're small enough that you have to look close, and some people don't notice them. This is true of nearly every good stacked dado set on the market....maybe all, but I haven't looked at all of them yet! The better ones are a bit less pronounced than the Oshlun's, but they all exist to some degree. A box joint set could provide perfectly flat dados, but the width can't be varied much, and they'll produce more tear out on cross grain cuts.

        "answer": "Most likely you will not be able to build a deck or wall with it. But it is perfect for light duties where there is a lot of screws and where impact driver would be overkill and manual screwdriver would kill your wrist. I was using it recently for repair of a wall switches. It wouldn't take out one of the screws holding electrical wire - the others it did manage. Good thing about this screwdriver is that it has locked spindle. In my case I just loosen the screw manually with DeWalt screwdriver (without pressing the switch) - then used it regular way. I also have put together a few Ikea furniture - it was great help. Also have drilled small holes in drywall and studs for shelves fasteners. It excels in situations where you have long screws which would take forever with manual screwdriver - like, for example, the screws holding a wall switch to the electrical box. Don't expect it to be a tool good for everything. You will still need impact driver when you will need more torque and drill for serious drilling. The gyroscoping action is something to get used to, sometimes it is annoying. But I think it is more smooth in action then variable speed trigger switch. I don't regret buying this screwdriver, use it all time - my only wish is it was cheaper (or at least DeWalt would add to the kit the DCL023 flashlight)"

My D28110, D28402, and D28065 all measure very close to 1.75\" diameter at the neck, as does the inside diameter of my DWE46150. If your DWE4011 has a 1.75\" neck between the wheel guard and gear housing, then this shroud should be compatible though I cannot guarantee it. The real issue is: 12000 rpm on a concrete accessory seems geared too high. I bought my 9000 rpm D28065 specifically for a concrete grinding project because it is geared much lower than a 4-1/2\" grinder. You're going to bog down any gearing higher than 9000 rpm anyway, possibly overheating your 7 amp motor, so I figured tractor the gearing down. Since the project I bought it for, my D28065 has saved other projects. As always, air hammering the web between rotary hammer holes is the fastest way for most people to remove bulk concrete, not knowing the nature of your project. Hope this helps. Happy New Year to you and all."

My only complaint is the sprayer. It is very heavy and really a great sprayer but it leaks when in the upright position after you use it. The company gave us a replacement but it didn't help. So instead after we use it we hang it down into the sink until it drains and then put it back upright. Other then that it is a really well made faucet!"

They all said that even if my window did have it, they are only nailed in with small bradnails and would NOT make this ladder any more stable. They say is is perfectly fine to use, as the the white part of the clamp, is shorter than the red clamp that attatches to the outside of the house. This will make your weight help secure the clamps. I hope this made since. If my escape is cut off, I have to jump out the 2 story with airconditioner units under me. I'll be shredded. This is what I got.

        "answer": "OK, there seems to be a lot of confusion here as to switch wiring. In a conventional setting, a wall switch will \"break\" only one side of the electric circuit (BLACK wire). The white wires are tied together, but NOT switched. Typically all the white wires are tucked in the back of the switchbox to keep them out of the way. Tie the Maxxima's GREEN wire to the ground (bare) wire that you removed from the old switch. Tie the Maxxima's WHITE wire to the WHITE wire bundle (2 wires for one switch, 3 wires for a second switch, et. cetera.) Tie the Maxxima's RED wire to one of the BLACK wires that came from the old switch. Tie the Maxxima's BLACK wire to the remaining BLACK wire. The Maxxima's Red & Black wires are the \"switch\". If, when you turn the circuit back on, the blue lights on the unit are ON, then you're OK. If not, REVERSE the Maxxima's Red & Black wires."

        "answer": "You'll get a longer run time with the 3.0 amp battery and it's still not a long time - 3 hours or less. Go to the Makita Tools website at http://makitatools.com/en-us/Modules/Tools/ToolDetails.aspx?Name=BCF201Z and click on the PDF \"Instruction Manual.\" On page four of the manual there is a table that lists approximate run times for 14V and 18V and for 1.5 and 3.0 amps at each voltage. According to the table going from 1.5 amps to 3.0 (at 18V) essentially doubles the run time on low speed from 90 minutes to 200 minutes. So base your decision on what you need to do with the fan. I have the Makita fan and I like it, but the run times are quite short for what I use it for. I ended up also buying the Ryobi cordless fan which runs much longer - up to 10 hours on low speed."

When we installed the faucet, the fittings had a small crack in them that we did not notice until the water leaked through the ceiling into the downstairs. We went back to Lowes to find a fitting to replace the broken one. None of the fittings at all the hardware stores would fit. I contacted the company, they never responded. Nice looking faucet, waste of money. I ended up buying a different faucet and just throwing this one away. Complete waste of money."

Just Google it. But THIS tool is well worth the price. It's an Excellent tool. I ONLY buy Dewalt 18v tools. They work very well and the batteries hold their charge a long time and are interchangeable between my different tools.

They make a very tight fit but are very easily removed. And be careful when you are mounting the taped strip. The tape is very, very sticky. Not repositionable at all. I tried to reposition one in our hallway and it tore the top layer of drywall off. They work like a charm though. We really like them. They light up a dark hallway for my elderly mother and I only had to use 2."

But with full extension slides you be much better off if you can figure a way to secure the slides to the cabinet walls rather than putting all the leveraged weight on those brackets.

Even though water runs rapidly down the trough, I've had no leaking now for 2 years. I also used it to seal a leak on my ATV tir rim. The rim had a slight curve and wouldn't hold air. I sealed the sot that was leaking and it worked perfectly."

        "answer": "Yes, the stand does come with these. These are extras in case you want to have multiple tools set up to use on the stand. For instance, I used the ones I purchased on my Kreg Foreman pocket hole machine. I know of a contractor that uses 2 miter saws on one stand when trimming out a house so that he doesn't have to toggle back and forth between right and left hand miters. He just leaves each saw set up for the different cuts and it speeds up his work."

I figure each pot weighs close to 30-35 pounds, and there are four on each shelf, plus littler plants in smaller pots, also filled with rocks and dirt. Heavy! Yet to date the entire shelf structure is still holding steady. In fact it seems like it would exceed expectations if put to the test. I can't imagine any of the components collapsing under even 350 pounds, it is a genius design. Highly recommend."

If your furnace or boiler does not provide a 24 volt lead you could use an external power supply to power this thermostat. If you have extra conductors available to use in your thermostat wire, you could plug it into the service plug next to your boiler or furnace. Then by connecting the external power supply to the tstat wire, you could power the tstat. If you don't have any unused conductors in your tstat wire, you could power it by feeding it power at the thermostat. While this is do-able. It would be ugly because there would be visible wires leading from the outlet where the power supply is plugged, into the back of the tstat."

        "answer": "With almost all power tools, reducing the power is the only way to reduce the speed. Most tools with variable speed triggers like drills or routers, the triggers are just variable resistors that reduce the power to the actual motor. The more you let off of the trigger, the more resistance, and the less power gets to the motor. This does the exact same thing as the trigger on a variable speed drill. One word of caution when using one of these, do not use it on tools with Laser Guides, or other \"high tech\" electronics. Only on bare bone basic power tools. I used this on my mitre saw with a laser guide to slow the blade speed down so I could use it as a chop saw and cut metal tubing. Well, the laser guide did not like the cut in voltage and after about 5 minutes of cutting, the laser guide electronics literally went up in smoke. Not just a little smoke, holy crap get the fire extinguisher kind of smoke. Needless to say I now have a mitre saw without a laser guide, but it worked great to cut the metal tubing!!!"

All products are designed to be floating floors and are to be installed without adhesive. The flooring should not be adhered to the subfloor in any way. Vinyl engineered panel flooring products in the Matterhorn collection should not be installed in areas subjected to humidity levels higher than those recommended or in extreme wet areas. The floor must be level. I hope that information helps. thank you for your inquiry."

        "answer": "Yes, instructions are useless. Is there something specific you don't understand? You may need adapters to connect to your system since they vary a lot. If you have a 3 hole sink, you need to cover the other two with either a full plate (available on Amazon) or individual hole plugs available at the hardware store. I don't recall which connection is hot and cold, but I just opened the faucet full hot or cold and blew into one pipe to see which if it was open or closed. The flex hose from the sprayer connects to short center pipe, connect after you have it mounted. I believe it uses one small rubber washer, there were extra washers with mine. The big black weight is attached to the flex hose at the bottom of it's loop to help the sprayer retract. The button on the sprayer toggles between spray and stream each time you push it and stays in whatever mode it's in when you turn it off/on."

It's a three way rotary switch that switches one wire on, then the other, then both, then off. So by hooking the second wire up to two lamps, you get one lamp, then two, then all three, then off.

        "question": "This Compressor says 4.1 CFM but will it run a nail gun that requires 4.5 ?",
        "answer": "I own several Hitachi NR83A3 framing nailers and this compressor keeps up. If one takes the cfm of air per cycle needed for that nailer and divides it into 4.1 you get 64 cycles per minute. I do not know of anyone who can keep that up. The CFM rating of 4.1 is at 90psi and not 120 which I run my framing nailers at. I bought this compressor because I wanted a compressor I could use in conjunction with another when I needed more CFM like when I texture drywall. I like the idea that this compressor is 100% duty cycle. None of these compressors I am aware of are all that good at starting in freezing weather but this compressor seems to be the best of its type. I have other compressors which are belt driven with more power and they are much better in freezing weather but they cost a lot more and are much heavier. When the compressor first starts with no air in the tank it has a check valve at the top of the compressor that allows air to bypass the tank until it has been running for a short time. This seems to help it start when it is cold and the air compressor has not run all night. Once there is some air in the tank you never hear it again until after you drain the tank. Before I bought this compressor I looked for one with a 100% duty cycle rating and found that there are very few available. While this compressor may look like most others it is my favorite hand carry compressor. After a short time I started using synthetic compressor oil because I think that helps a compressor start easier in cold weather and helps it to last longer. Before I changed the oil I spoke with someone at the company and they were great about helping me."

Just be sure the warm damp air is not contained in a small room where it will get steamy and damp. The device is flimsy, but my husband hooked it up very securely so the air vents into the room.

They add right about 1/4\" to the height, probably not enough to worry about. The thing you should probably be more worried about is the thickness of the \"nail\" portion of the chair glide relative to the thickness of the chair or table leg you are going to nail it to. Be really careful here. If the chair or table leg is less than about 1.25\" you risk splitting the wood. That happened on one or two legs of 4 chairs I nailed them to - a total of 2 out of 8 legs - and I am a very handy and experienced person. I was able to salvage the situation with wood glue and clamps. The chair legs were only about 1\" in diameter, and made of oak, so they were very hard. A bit bigger diameter or a softer wood and probably no splitting would have occurred."

The bolt is activated to retract just prior to opening the door and extend after the door is down. It's pretty reassuring to hear that \"clunk\" and know that the door is locked tight. You may also manually slide the bolt if needed (i.e. power outage)."

        "answer": "The needed power supply is dependent on how much you are sending signal too. For example, I'm using this for a 15' strand of RGB LED rope, that uses 30 Watts at 12V, so the 12V 2.5A power supply I'm using JUST does what I need. If I tried to do a longer strand, I'd have problems because it would require more amperage. This unit has a max output rating of 8A per channel (24A total). You need a little basic electrical understanding to figure out what is suitable for your needs. Watts = Volts x Amperage"

I have the normal extension on the fan and the overall height is a hair over 14\". The official spec says 14.25\". It would be pointless for the extension to only add 1.25\". A rough guess with the tape measure shows the extension between the base of the canopy and the fan adds nearly 3 1/2\". So I would say the height is somewhere between 10\"-11\". Most people may not care about a two or three inch difference, but I'm mounting a projector behind the fan and every little bit counts to ensure it's not blocking the picture. I plan on ordering another one and flush mounting it. I will measure the height and report back."

The wires were covered in a cord that matched the fixture (oiled bronze). We had the electrician that wired the addition install all the fixtures and I don't think he had any issues with these. I posted a picture of one of the lights. I saw where they are $7.99 now so you wouldn't be out much if you wanted to try a longer cord. (Ours were twice that)"

        "answer": "Yes. Mobile homes, also known as manufactured homes, are required to comply with the rules laid down by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mobile homes are plumbed for specific water heaters and they can be quite complicated to replace. Consequently the cost of a mobile home water heater is significantly more. Mobile home water heaters are different than regular water heaters in three main ways: Mobile home water heaters have interchangeable gas and propane orifices so that the water heater can be converted from natural gas to propane gas operation. This is the main reason for the increased cost. Mobile home water heaters have the cold water inlet connection on the side and the hot water outlet connection on top. Residential water heaters have all connections on the top of the tank. A mobile home heater comes with a securing strap kit"

        "answer": "It will work as long as you can find a mount that will fit both your 870 and the light. Problem is the light housing is narrow and not a standard size like other weapon lights. Behind the lenses bell the light body diameter is .900 so it's tough to find a mount to fit that. Another issue is your mount needs to stand off far enough from your weapon so the lenses of the light doesn't hit it. Another issue since most lights don't have a big lense like this one. I love the light and have one on my AR with a remote coil using a 1\" Viking mount and a few layers of shrink wrap around the body so it will fit snug since the mount is for a 1\" light. I'm sure there are better mounts out today then when I got mine. As long as it will clamp down below .900. But for my 870 I personally would not like it as it's overkill. For all my shotguns I use streamlight M3's with their corresponding shotgun mounts which are nice as I can slip them on and off the picatiny rail. Works very well and lower profile sitting closer to the weapon. But it's a personal choice. Hope that helps!"

What you need to be concerned about is running too much power though the switch which could cause an electrical fire. your fans are rated at 31 watts for the fan and two 40-watt light bulbs, therefore with two fans you will have a demand of 62 watts on the fan control and 160 watts on the light control. the switch is rated for 143 watts on the fan and 300 watts on the light, so you should be OK. You should still check with a local electrician that is familiar with electrical codes in your area to make sure you're safe. Good Luck!"

If they are close with the new one slightly larger, you can probably trim the excess. It's matching the holes that matters, but it shouldn't be a big concern because you can probably punch holes through the thin metal plate to match yours. To me, it's worth a shot. Al"

        "answer": "The L, N and GROUND are for the AC Input. The WHITE wire from the strip goes to the +12 V screw on the Power supply. If you hook the Blue wire to COM, the BLUE LEDs will light. If you hook the Green wire to COM, the GREEN LEDs will light and the same for the RED wire/RED LEDs. If you hook Blue, Green and Red all up to COM at the same time you will get WHITE. There should have been a small white controller box and a remote control. The strip hooks to the controller and then the +12v and COM from the power supply hook to the power connector on the controller. Then with the remote you can select the color and pattern you want the strip to use."

In general, the higher the strand count the more flexible the wire. Wire with silicon insulation is usually much more flexible as well. This stuff is nowhere near 'wet noodle' soft, but it can still be bent easily enough."

The iPhone app lacks much of the functionality promised during the campaign. There is no time resolved heart rate or breathing rate available to the user. I have been unable to verify that the \"smart alarm\" functionality works, it seems to go off at a predetermined time (i.e. exactly when you set it to go off before you go to bed). An Android app is currently non-existent despite its availability being promised by Beddit at launch time. The user must manually input (in the iPhone app) when they go to bed and then manually input when they wake up, otherwise the app will not be \"measuring.\" The company clearly does not understand the concept of a smart sensor. Breathing rate and noise monitoring data are non-existent. The heart rate data is averaged into one number and displayed to the user after stopping measurement at wake up time, the accuracy of this number is poor (as confirmed by a traditional heart rate monitor chest strap). The nightly sleep data is made available to the user upon waking as nebulous rectangles with rounded corners seemingly indicating general times when the sensor registered the user as being wake awake or asleep during the night. The manual that shipped with the product has pages with white backgrounds and was printed with WHITE ink (I thought this must be a joke). Overall the product experience has been extremely poor, both on the hardware and on the software side. The company clearly has no pride in their work (or else they would not have shipped), no quality control and lacks people with the necessary skill sets to bring a product to market. Stay away."

Within this piping one needs to include a \"tee\" into which a pressure gauge can be inserted. The gauge is required to set the low pressure on adjustment and the higher pressure off adjustment for the pressure switch on the pump motor. Most of the piping I used coming out of the pump was galvanized 1/2\" steel pipe and it resembled an octopus as it had to match up with existing copper pipe houseing. However it worked satisfactorily. What did bother me was the rather large size of the 1-1/4\" output on the pump housing. Using a steel reducing bushing there required a lot of plastic-Teflon pipe thread sealing tape to halt the leaks caused by the rather loose fit at that joint."

So you have to buy it from Woodcraft online (I purchased it from Woodcraft through Amazon). I checked my local Woodcraft store and it was not available. The shipping is nearly as much as the adapter! This is a key part because without it you can't mount anything to the stock base plate for this router. You could change out the clear plastic baseplate and get a PC compliant one, but that may just open up a new set of problems. The RA1100 threaded adapter fits into the quick change adapter and it allows you to screw in any PC guide that you would need. Thankfully, this part is available directly from Amazon.

        "answer": "Pretty tricky question. I'll answer it best with another question or two. IS the concrete a \"smooth\" surface or is it textured? I ask this because the Soygel works best on smooth surfaces - as would most paint removers. The nooks and crannies will make the removal more difficult. I just used the Soygel on a similar job - stone. The paint coating on it was heavy and thick. I had to use a thick coat which I let really set in, then used my drill with a rotary wire head. This got off allot of the paint, but I had to do it a 2nd time to get the rest off. So, depending on the amount of coats and how thick they are, will determine the amount of coverage you can get from a quart. For my application - which I will be completing over the next week, I estimate I will need a full quart to remove an area of 54 sq. ft. Remember, I will also be using multiple wire heads on my drill to get this job done. If you decide to follow this route, use tarps on anything painted that you went to keep painted."

        "answer": "Yes we have tried to fool it.and also my biometric safe..It does not open for photocopied fingerprints using even the best types of paper..The only thing it may open for is if you have a 3D printing machine that can mimic an exact silicone replica of your finger..It might open for that since it will have all the indentations and grooves of your finger..But then again why go through all that trouble when you can just go in someones backyard and kick through there window..or just take a sledge hammer and knock off the most toughest deadbolts........The Nextbolt to me is a better alternative to the standard dead bolt not only because of the little bit of increased security it gives ..but for the convenience it gives by not using keys..If you are looking for the ultimate security this should not be your top choice..You may want to consider getting a very good wireless Alarm system with motion sensor in every room using the best monitoring system tied directly to the police..Also you may want to setup internet survelance cameras with night vision around your premises so you can monitor your property on a daily basis.And probably half inch steel bars on every window with Ram resistant doors on every entry..This is how we use to live in South America......If you live in a bad area ..Do not buy the next bolt..Consider one of the other few options above that i listed.."

As it happened at the point I was tapping into the system (power going to the motor) the amperage was too great for this device. I would have burned it out. So originally I used batteries to run it. I got tired of that solution and it occurred to me that a AC/DC switching power converter could provide the solution I was looking for. I found one on eBay and hooked it up to where the power came into the treadmill (before the motor board). I then used this as my power supply for this device and it works great. Perhaps something like that could work for you? It was only $9.98. In my case I was looking for something small I could install inside the treadmill. I was able to bolt it down in the same general area as the motor control board. I've been using this solution now for almost a year and have had no problems."

It is at LEAST 12 inches long. Added text: I would also say I had the same concerns BECAUSE I had a thick wall (with the wood siding), and it was too long....so I cut it down. It will definitely be long enough for any standard exterior wall size."

The set comes with a varied set of plates so there is a good chance that it will fit your car. Note that this tool isn't always a substitute for a bench press. While I was able to use the plates that came with the set, I could not get the clamp to push the bearing out. Fortunately I was able to sledge hammer the plate and push the bearing out. I was quite surprised that a 4 pound sledge hammer provides enough impact force to easily push the bearing out."

And also, when you first installed the filter system on, let it run on cold water for about 4-5minutes, that's only when the filter is new, after that it will be ok.

There are these rubber fenders around the blade that prevent the water from spraying all over the place. The extended pan in the back of the cutter catches most the water coming off the saw. The water lost is minimal. I had to cut some larger tiles, 12x24, so most of the water lost came from the water spray onto the tile during the cut, especially when I removed the tile after the cut is made. As a matter of fact, it is so good catching the water, after awhile you need to replace it because of the amount of grime collected in the reservoir. gh"

        "answer": "You probably could use spray paint. The application requires wetting the paper (self-adhesive), so if you used spray paint it would be after putting it up on the wall. That might be a daring endeavor to avoid overspray. I used an interior latex paint using a paint roller. It's a beautiful pattern and it mimics punched tin ceiling tiles. I used it to create a faux backsplash in a kitchen. I highly recommend this wallpaper; beautiful and a great buy."

        "answer": "I personally use this item and can vouch for it. The only way this is a fire hazard is if people do not use it correctly. Yes there will be defective units, yes there may be accidents, but overall most fires started by these are caused by people who shouldn't even own pets. Putting a towel over this device or putting stuff around it is not smart at all and is in fact dangerous. The device itself as far as I have seen does not catch fire, and in fact does not produce enough heat TO catch on fire. I put blame on the users, not the item or manufacturer except in the case of defective units sold. Hope this was a reasonable answer. I love this product. UPDATE: Adding to my previous comment, it seems as though there was a curse on this company as a whole bunch of people got faulty devices, poor things. Mine is still working great, no shorts. Seems to me like there were assembly issues within the manufacturer building or they got some terribly made pieces to construct these with. I am only glad that mine was not one of the ill-fated defects!"

        "answer": "No this device does NOT support load sensing. It will do what you say by reporting its status back to your controller, but that is not load sensing it is status reporting. Load sensing is when the unit allows you to control whatever device you plug into it manually and still allow monitored control. ie: you can control a lamp plugged into the receptacle by using its switch but yet still control it via z-wave. This device does not support load sensing."

        "answer": "Hi, there are two moveable joints here...each move as hinges only...just up/down, not side to side. The top arm does Not go fully vertical...it's max angle is roughly 145 degrees with bottom arm fully vertical. The bottom arm movement is just 45 degree max. It goes fully vertical, but downwards to about 45 degrees only...it will not slope down to be fully horizontal/parralel with your desk. Now, the lamp is lightweight, so while the hinges don't swivel side to side, just move the base...it does not scratch your desk. Overall, I love this lamp with its different settings. The USB charger is very useful. Note, the top arm does fully collapse to the bottom arm and when closed like this, the lamp can be completely vertical in this closed position. I keep my lamp in basically a 90 degree position and rarely move it. I don't think the lamp is designed for constant movement, say if you were a jeweler...that would be too much wear/tear. Hope that helps. Mark in NY"

You install the LED engine into your opening using the provided screws, connect your wires, and finally twist just the smaller 1/4\" deep part of that decorative casing back onto the LED portion. You discard the top outer ring. The size of these puck lights is 2 5/8\" x 1 13/16\". That would be the be the size when surface mounted. When recessed, only the 1/4\" portion will show.

I'm very satisfied with it although people tell me it's movable - could be stolen - and that I will need a larger one - I use more than one fireproof box to store different valuables in different places that are not obvious. I also leave cash and fake jewelry easily found for thieves in a hurry. I would google the question if you haven't already."

        "answer": "For this Flash-light, I measured its strong spot-beam to be slightly over 10-degrees in diameter, and its weak flood-beam about 72-degree in diameter. In other words (and rounding), it creates a strong spot-like round beam of 2-feet in diameter from about 11-feet distance, and exhibits a weak flood-like round beam of slightly over 7 feet in diameter from 5 feet away. Just to be complete, this correspond to the T6 diving light, single white LED, twist-on, with 3 visible o-rings on the thread, and a 3.7 Li-Ion 3000mAh battery. I tested it with the cap twisted all the way in, and with a freshly charged battery. The measurement is a result of subjective observations from two subjects (my wife and myself:-)) performed at two different distances for each beam type."

        "answer": "No your current system has a 80+5 capacitor because that's what your current engine requires. If order this motor, you can keep your current capacitor provided you've tested it properly and it is functioning properly. There's too numbers there, 80 and 5 so long as the first number is at least 50 that requirement is met. The second number is more precise. for example you could not go with a 50+7.5 capacitor, it has to be +5. In your case of having a 80+5, 80 is well higher rated than it needs to be so your good there, and the +5 is spot on so your current capacitor will work fine (again provided your capacitor hasn't gone bad.) Hope that helps."

In new condition it will take a bit to conform to face. The lens sits a fair ways from face so depending on size of eyeglasses, the fit might be fine. Given there is a seal, figment might depend on how close arms sit to face. If airtight seal is not a requirement, you may be alright however if tighter seal is required, arms of glasses would be an issue."

Although this meter does not appear to come with an extended warranty, at 29.99 I was not that concerned about it. I purchased 3 meters for less than it would cost for one comparable warrantied meter. I have been using them for a short while and thus far I have no complaints. I am impressed with this meter's performance and accuracy, especially considering its price. The meter has a 10 MegOhm Impedance which is NOT LOW. Anyone using this meter should remember to always make sure the leads are disconnected prior to turning the meter's range switch. I like this model of meter, and am impressed by its performance especially at such a low price. It is a bit premature for me to criticise or recommend the longevity of these meters. For now I hope my meters will last, but I am still very pleased that I decided on them."

        "answer": "The mesh is pretty tight. I think it would work well to protect your hands from the combs of a mandolin. When I try to poke the tip of a sharp knife straight through the weave only 1/8 inch pokes through. It could go through the glove and cut you but it wouldn't go very deep. And you would really have to work to get a knife or other sharp object at an angle that would cause it to go through the glove. Also the weave is a bit thicker, the links overlap slightly, when the glove is relaxed, giving you more protection. When the glove stretches over your hand as you are using it, it opens up to a single link but this stops most sharps just fine. Hope this helps!"

Flip side is, usually you can not support your work piece with left hand so you may need to clamp/support what you are cutting. Depends.

        "answer": "Peggy, If the salt is on the outside of the tank then the salt and water brine are overflowing the the tank. Inside the brine tank is a vertical tube that contains a valve to to stop water filling when the brine tank is full. It might have failed or the brine fill valve might be leaking allowing water to flow into the brine tank when the system isn't recharging. If I were you I'd look at the brine tank and see where the water level is. It shouldn't be higher than 1 foot from the bottom. If it is, you need a repair. My resin tank (the one in the middle) was porous and leaking water into the brine tank. I fixed it with epoxy. ps Any leak in the in/out water connections usually winds up in the brine tank.

        "answer": "Lutron makes a large selection of switches for different functions. If you just wanted the other switch to control lighting, they make single-control switches that would be more appropriate. There are different varieties for controlling LCD/CFL lighting that can be dimmed as well as switches for conventional incandescent bulbs. Amazon lists them all. They are similar in design and functionality to this Lutron fan/light control and would be a good match visually as well as functionally."

PLS is their Pro line that's meant to be purchased from and installed/troubleshot by your electrical contractor, RPLS is Retail/Consumer/DIY line, so they do honor their warranty for the DIYer on the RPLS line. I wonder if PLS is even supposed to be available through other than a contractor. Only reason to go w/the PLS 750c is if you need 3-way or 21 program slots.

I recommend the 60/2936 for the typical bath installation because CFLs fail too quickly when turned on and off frequently, as happens in the typical bathroom.

You'll only need to provide a PC, and, if you buy our standard parallel port system, a parallel cable and CNC software (such as KCam, EMC2 of Mach3). If you buy with our USB Solution the USB interface, cable and FabCAM software are included, you'll just need a host computer. If you'd like an itemized parts list for the contents of our kit, just provide the product you're interested in and an e-mail address and we can send that to you. Hope this helps, MyDIYCNC"

A part in the shower faucet was different looking than the one in the installation manual so we contacted Delta to make sure it was the correct part. They immediately sent us a replacement part -- free of charge -- to make sure our plumber had everything he needed. We decided that the installation manual illustrations may not have been updated when a new part was introduced and this led to the confusion. We had the correct part all along, but Delta made sure we were taken care of. We are very impressed with Delta and with the beautiful faucets."

If you are one to take care of your equipment, then you won't need jaws for at least 10+ years. If this is for a business, I would search the Internet for a manufacturer contact # and request where to buy more jaws. I have this vise for my home workshop, I don't foresee needing new jaws for the next 15 years. But I don't beat up my vise, I use it for small projects. Hope this helps."

After doing so I remember thinking that I wish I had bought a long time ago because it looked so nice. If the light is recessed, it might work for you. I guess it all depends on how your current fixture attaches covers to it. Again, I had to drill a hole in it and use my existing decorative washer to secure it. It worked great for me.

        "answer": "There aren't any. The reason for this is because each table saw is different so providing instructions would be a generalization at best, unsafe at worst. Use is pretty simple - you take off your arbor bolt and remove the current saw blade. You put the dado set's blade on first taking note of the direction the saw turns. Then you add as many of the variable width chippers to create the width you want. Then add in the other dado blade on the arbor bolt, bolt it all in place and away you go. Please take note that many table saws have arbor bolt length restrictions so you may not get the full width you want. I cannot do 3/4\" dado's on my table saw despite having this kit for example. Finally - please ensure you have a table saw insert specifically for dados. The alternative is to remove your insert which is unsafe. Most manufacturers sell aftermarket table inserts for a reasonable price...mine cost me $18 or so. Good luck!"

A small label next to the light sensor lists the options: 0 turns the output on, A is auto-on, that is whenever the outside light level gets low enough, everything is on. Continuing with the up arrow, it does auto with timed shutoff and each number corresponds to the number of hours before it shuts off. For example, I use a setting of 3, which turns on the lights around 8:50 PM and shuts them off 3 hours later. Pretty crude controls, but I really don't need anything more more."

If they are high intensity or double LEDs then they are 60 watts which is the maximum of this transformer. so If its 30 watts then 32', if high intensity then 16'. It's all about the watts!"

But then it would cost too much to buy it. In this case they took a great concept and made it as cheap as practicable so the lower minions could afford it. You also need to drill two holes, two on each side of lower compartment and string two bungies across to keep the bottom box from bowing. You will also find that the latches are soooo cheap you can bend then with two fingers! They make another box similar and cheaper that is BETTER than this one. Check it out. I use it to hold all my shooting gear. I shoot IPSC/IDPA style combat with rifle/pistol. It holds all my detritus very well. Anything LIGHT. If you try to stuff this thing with anything heavy, it does not work. Hope this helped. Want to go shooting with us? FRED"

        "answer": "Hi Arnold, Yes, I have found the quality of the Nebo Ultra Socket Combo Kit to be very good. It has a solid feel to it with good balance as you hold it in your hand. I use it almost daily in my job. For use on a motorcycle, you may want to add an extension or 2 in order to reach into some tight spaces. Otherwise, it is a very good, compact set of tools that will fit nicely in a small space, such as under seat. Regards, Bruce"

It will not thaw a frozen water pipe, but if the cable is properly insulated (make sure to see the manufacturer's instructions for proper insulation procedure), the cable should prevent a pipe from freezing down to -50 degrees F.

        "question_type": "yes/no",
        "question": "is it energy efficient",
        "answer": "A 1,500-Watt heater running at maximum output (i.e., not cycling on-and-off after it reaches the desired room temperature) uses 1.5 kilowatts per hour. If your electric rate is 10 cents per kilowatt-hour (probably around the national average), then you're spending $0.15 per hour. Used 10 hours daily, this would cost $1.50 per day to use. If the unit is sized properly to the room, it should cycle on-and-off when it reaches the set temperature and therefore use somewhat less electricity than this estimate. Electric heat is generally the most expensive source. The BTUs from natural gas are much cheaper. Where you will save money (and help our planet) is by being able to concentrate the heat in rooms where it's needed and lower the temperature on the main home heating system. We don't use much of our upper level where the master bedroom is located, so using a local heat source allows us to keep this area around 60 degrees F except for the rooms we occupy (e.g., bedroom at night, bathroom periodically for baths and showers). If you were to run this unit at maximum output 24 hours daily, at 10 cents per kilowatt-hour it would cost $108 per month (1.5 kilowatts/hour [times] 24 hours/day [times] 30 days/month [times] $0.10/kilowatt-hour). If you're paying more than this, your electrical bill is obviously over 10 cents per kilowatt hour (remember to figure the total cost including the delivery charges and tax) like our rates in Western New York which run closer to 15 centers per kilowatt-hour (FYI: the actual rate varies with monthly usage. Higher usage levels are charged at a somewhat lower rate). Finally, realize that all 1,500-Watt heaters produce approximately the same amount of heat (i.e., that's what the \"1,500-watts\" represents in the specification); the differences are in how well they distribute that heat and how often they have to cycle on-and-off (cycling tends to use more energy). Oil-filled heaters tend to give a more consistent flow of heat into the room and therefore feel more comfortable by avoiding the spikes in higher and lower temperatures. A true infrared heater will heat objects in the room, not the air. These heaters tend to be more \"efficient\" in the sense that the effect of heating the air is quickly lost with small air drafts, while heating the 'objects' in a room retains the heat much better while producing the same type of comfort typical of an oil-filled heater. (I don't own this heater, so I can't comment on its actual performance, but I do note that the reviews seem overall positive for this model.)"

I'm not a good welder by any means, but with a little practice, I can weld really light stuff Vs. burning thru with the stick. The first time I used it, I thought I had made a mistake, since I had a har time welding, but the second day, after reviewing the settings again, I did, in my opinion, rather well.

        "answer": "It depends on the water. 'Fresh' water is generally not pure H2O. Even tap water has dissolved solids in it as evidenced by the calcium or 'lime' deposits seen on faucets and sinks after the water evaporates. The strobe is activated when it senses an electric current between two electrodes. When dry, it remains off because air is a poor conductor. It will probably not activate in pure rain water or distilled water, which are also not good conductors of electricity. I have activated the strobe in tap water, but it takes longer than in sea water. Most fresh water lakes and streams probably will activate the strobe, but the time to activation will vary depending on how pure the water is. The best safety practice is to test the strobe just before use by putting it in the water you encounter to see if it activates."

        "answer": "I'm not sure what you mean by \"holes are spaced 3\" and 4\" vice. However, the slots on the moveable press table are spaced 4-3/8\" apart and are 5/8\" wide. This means of course that your vice, if you used 1/2\" bolts to secure it, must have a minimum center to center distance of 4-1/4\". The approximate maximum center to center distance that could be bolted diagonally to the table is 6\". However, if the vise were placed diagonally on the table, it may interfere with the column."

It is designed for a catastrophic event and will last 4-7 days. If you have been through an earthquake that leaves your water and electricity out for 4-7 days, as I have, this is the best deal. I would suggest adding any medications or pet food as well as cash to the canvas bag as I know, these items are hard to come by. Keep your gas tank above half as the stations will not have electricity to pump gas. As we all know, it's not whether an earthquake will happen we are due."

I removed the old fixture and replaced it with this one as a front porch light. Our house has a typical stucco textured wall. Wish I could put a link to their manual but their website (http://designersedge.com) is not there yet :o). But all in all, I don't see why you couldn't install this on horizontal lap siding as long the area this needs to installed on, is flat. There's not much \"cavity\" / space at the back of the unit so the wall opening would have to have space for the junction wires etc. Sorry couldn't help more. But I love the light. It's basically trouble-free (for the lazy amongst us!). You never have to turn it on or off! The light is really bright white though it \"stands out\" odd in my community - all the other houses have those yellowish dull lights that are there more for name sake than for lighting!

        "question": "Good day, I have a question regarding ALEKO AR900 Gate Opener: 1) Can be connected to the source of 110v home while having connected my 12v batteries (configured on 24v) on the control board? 2) I have my charge controller LM118, with my solar panel...",
        "answer": "Freddy, Yes you can connect 110Volts and 24 volt battery. In this configuration the 110volt charges the battery. NOTE In this configuration the battery acts as a backup in power failure when 110 volts go out. You cannot use solar support - panel charger etc. 2. The LM 118 is the recommended Charge Controller but it seems like (1) the batteries aren't being charged properly or (2) the batteries are losing power somewhere. In the night the batteries would discharge through the solar panels but the charge controller should take care of this. What you can do is monitor the voltages over one night. Check the battery voltage at early night 6:00pm and in the morning when it does not open the gate. Then the second night disconnect the solar panel and check before and early morning again. If there is a stark difference you may need a higher specification charge controller. Also (3) make sure the solar panel is charging the batteries to their full capacity. A proper panel should deliver between .5 amps to 1 amp at hot sun to charge the batteries properly. I hear the solar input is not an effective input. The power of the gate opener is reduced through this input since the unit is compensating for this low power input. As you have explained I would condemn the solar input. Connect the 110 volt and connect the 24 volts to the battery input. The 110 charges the batteries to full power and when power goes you have the fully charged 24 volts to take over. Also, sounds as though your solar kit is stronger than the ones in the Aleko kit. The solar remains a great option since it is the main quality of this opener. Experiment with the efficiency of the kit and when you are certain of its reliability then you can connect this option. The charge changes with the sun intensity. Dull rainy days will not allow proper charge etc. All in all it is a well designed and full featured item."

The worst part is the danger of dropping the saw to your side after a cut is finished. A left handed saw puts the blade close to your leg as you drop the saw and increases the risk of cutting your leg. We had this happen at work by a skilled user trying to use a lefty's saw. Changing something that he was simply accustomed to begged an accident and he found it one miserable day and did serious damage to his leg. It was ugly! Use right side blade for right-hand, left side for lefty when possible. If your situation requires something different you should determine to use extra caution until finished."

I'm not a metallurgist but I scraped the inside of one of the rings and there was no difference in the color of the metal, the rings are very sturdy and don't bend easily, so my guess is that it's chrome plated stainless steel. Hope that helps."

        "answer": "Okay, I'm pretty sure this is what you are facing. First, the red/blue \"plug\" that you lost was simply an indicator showing a turn of the handle to the right (red) would turn on the hot water; a turn to the left(blue) is, of course, the cold. Inside the hole is a fitting that accepts a hex tool that put into the fitting will tighten a loose handle (or, I suppose will allow the handle to be removed). I have never actually removed the handle, but have tightened the handle many times. If you look into the hole with a flashlight, you can barely see the fitting into which the hex tool will fit. My recollection is that you must use a 5/32\" hex, and you must be careful not to \"strip\" the fitting -- I've done that on other plumbing fixtures and they are really tough to replace - at that point you might as well replace the faucet. By the way Pfister has an 800 number with courteous people from what I remember. Hope this helps; Good luck!"

        "answer": "The shower arm and the filter body both have NPT threads. These are both tapered threads. In order for the filter to stop spinning, the nut has to be deep enough into the threads of the shower arm. Otherwise the nut will allow the filter body to keep spinning. Just hold the filter body in the position that you want it and tighten the nut until the filter body doesn't spin any more. Then tighten it a little more so that the threads seal against each other. It is a good idea to use teflon tape on the threads of the shower arm to make sure the threads seal properly and so that you can remove it later if you need to. This is not a job for tightening the nut by hand. You may want to use two pairs of pliers; one pair to hold the shower arm and the other one to turn the nut so that the shower arm doesn't turn inside the wall and so you can get the proper tightness. I hope this helps."

I too resigned myself to just bringing a custom table into the field if I was cutting stacks and needed it tighter than that tolerance. This stand is hard to beat for convenience but you usually always give up something for convenience. The nylon washer idea may be worth a try. The other problem is that as these stands wear out, the problem will get worse. Mine slopped quite a bit before I bought a new set but to be fair I had field repaired them many times before replacing. Not quite bubble gum and duct tape mind you, but they definately looked pretty Frankensteined at the end of their life"

        "answer": "Since Craftsman is a Sears brand and they usually have other companies making their brands (e.g., Kenmore), suggest you check to see if it fits in your charger. I may be wrong, but it seems that every company who makes battery-operated electric tools has completely different batteries so you can only buy their batteries to use with their chargers. It also appears that WORX doesn't even sell these anymore. They have changed over to Lithium batteries which don't fit their older equipment and use different chargers."

        "answer": "Hi Katie! The ladder folded is 17\" wide and about 5 or so inches deep and 48 inches tall. When opened up it is 17 inches wide and about 25 inches deep or from the front feet to the back feet. The top of the 3 steps measures out at about 24 inches above the floor and the andle is still right at 48 inches high giving you that very comfortable 24 inch high grab handle. The only negative we found on this ladder was the brittle plastic feet and side caps which seem prone to having cracked in shipping during the winter when we purchased ours. Since having it these last 3 years or so, there has been no problem with any broken plastic, but originally the first ladder arrived with a broken piece. I blame the plastic as not being designed for the cold like it would be on a ladder designed for outdoor use and Polder could certainly choose to use better material."

I have Calphalon Hard Anodized pots and pans. Although I'd clean them, I still had lots of grease build up. I sprayed the areas with this Dawn, waited about 30 minutes and the bulk of the build up washed off. I did have to repeat the process on some of the Calphalon as well as use Brillo pads and some elbow grease. They now look brand new! This has now become my \"new best friend\". &lt;g&gt; I first purchased, via the internet, through Wal-Mart. 3 bottles, plus shipping came to about $5.50/bottle. I have now discovered that my local Ace Hardware store carries it for $3.99/bottle. I live in Southern California."

If it's not set in concrete you may be able to use this if you can fashion some way to secure the pipe to a chain. It could be a piece of 3/8\" flat steel plate with a slightly oblong hole in it for the pipe and another hole for a hook. When set over the pipe and lifted by the hook hole, the plate angles up and the oblong hole tightens against the pipe. The harder you pull the tighter it gets. If the pipe is really deep or set very strongly it might bend the pipe a little but probably not. Again, if it's set in concrete you won't get it out with a puller."

        "answer": "Yes, under certain circumstances. 1) If you have a device (such as a floor steam cleaner) that does not have an on/off switch, this can become the defacto on/off switch allowing you more flexibility in the use of the device and less wear and tear on your outlets. 2) For devices in the kitchen or bathroom where a surge protector could be dangerous. 3) chargers - for tablets, cell phones, etc -- allows me to leave the charger plugged in and turn off the power when not actually using the charger. In my case, this helps me NOT misplace my charger - which happens when I just unplug it and someone moves it on me. ;) | I like these because they have a ground (3 prongs). Several \"cheaper\" models and some not cheaper only offer a polarized plug (2 prongs) and therefore limit the type of appliances/devices you can use on them."

The three AA batteries will go into the battery pack with the negative end (-) or flat end against the spring. Two of the batteries will go one way and the third will go in upside down compared to the other two. The battery pack has a little knob in the center versus an indention on the other end. The pack goes into the flashlight barrel, knob end first (toward the light) and the indention end toward the screw on back plate. I hope this helps.

On my Werner MT-22, I measured the actual floor-to-step height as follows: Step 1: 11-1/2\" Step 2: 22-3/4\" Step 3: 34\" Step 4: 45-1/2\" Step 5: 56-1/4\" Step 6: 67-3/4\" Step 7: 79\" Step 8: 90-1/2\" Top Step: 102\" I expect that the step-to-step distances would be the same (or very close to same) on the MT-13, MT-17, and MT-26, although the number of steps would of course be different. By the way, it's a superb ladder! Stable, rugged, versatile, easy to set up, easy to store, and (worth saying again) very stable. Well worth the price."

If your tank [if u are putting it on a tank] has a pump that is similar to this u might be fine, but my tank and pump were older and was completely different in how it hooked up.

If a thickness planer is not available , the operator may try using the joiner to reduce thickness of a board up to 6 inches wide by running the board across the joiner blades by pressing down and feeding the board manually. This will provide imperfect thickness throughout the board. The thickness planer applies uniform pressure on the board as it is automatically fed across the blades and thus provides precision thickness. Usually, boards up to 12 inches in width can be planed."

I thought mounting like this put the light closer to the working areas of the countertop below and minimized shadows from anything on the counter top (like the coffee maker). I can tell you these lights are very bright and we often use just these and not our overhead lights when working in the kitchen. Also, they are so small and thin, you can put them about anywhere without seeing them. We've had them installed over a year now and they still work perfectly.

If you were referring to the inbound call from this device, the answering machine will pick up and the device will deliver the message but since no one is responding it will hang up and call the next programmed number. It continues to do this until someone acknowledges the message by keying in one of two sequences (*0 to disable system or # to acknowledge and keep the system active so it will call again in 30 minutes if the alarm situation is still present)."

        "answer": "It would be risky. I understand that this epoxy has good shear strength, however, you have to consider what you are bonding it to. If the back of the mirror is smooth, the epoxy might not grab the microscopic \"valleys\" in the back of the mirror, thus poor adherence. Also, keep in mind that the mirror is in a vertical position, so you would have to hold it and press it up against the wall for at least 1.5 hours for it to set, and it still won't be totally cured until hours later. A heavy mirror makes it even more risky. There is nothing like mechanical fastening (anchor and bolt) in brick or mortar with a cable on the back of the mirror (the trust factor increases). You don't want to be abruptly woken up by a loud crash because the epoxy failed eh? Also, the epoxy will be difficult to get off your fireplace. This is all my opinion and may not be 100% pure science."

If you don't, you could create a negative pressure situation and suck air from inside your house. Although I don't see the point of having both go out, the point is to remove heat from the ceiling.

        "question": "I'd like to ask if the motion sensor will turn on lights from completely off state. Previous posting was not fully answered.",
        "answer": "Hmmm... ok I'll try to explain. On top of this 250 watt transformer is a mechanical timer and a switch to turn on/off the \"merlin\" system. Your choices are as follows: 1 use the \"merlin\" system or don't use the \"merlin\" system. With the \"merlin\" system on it uses the motion sensor to activate the lights from 100% brightness with motion activity or only 10% brightness(glow) when no motion is detected. The photo eye on bottom or transformer determines when the merlin system will activate....so at dusk the merlin system turns lights on slowly to about 10% provided that the motion sensor doesn't detect motion. But if motion sensor detects motion the merlin system will go to 100% bulb brightness. Keep in mind that if you choose to have the mechanical timer turn lights on and off they will be at full 100% brightness. With timer set to specific on/off times it will overide merlin activation except when dark outside because then Merlin system will use photo sensor inside motion sensor to determine if it can dim lights to 10%. (confused yet) After reading your question again the answer would be NO. The motion sensor is not intended to be a security spotlight... the \"Merlin\" system will only turn lights on from a dim 10% power state to full brightness 100% IF it detects motion. Why would you purchase this system when you can buy a motion activated flood light for less than $15.00 ???"

If you are thinking about buying one of these saws, hold out for one of the newer versions with the black rubber grip and the smaller battery bay that is intended for the Nano batteries. Either saw works just fine with either battery, but the newer version is much much more powerful and lasts longer on a battery.

        "question": "what is the neck size ? 3.5 or 4\" ?",
        "answer": "the neck size is 3.5\". However, it's not like the older style light kits that sit \"inside\" the base of the ceiling fan. On the older style fans, you would remove the cover from the bottom of the fan, then the light kit would slide up into the fan base and you would secure the kit with two or three screws. This light kit sits \"flush\" against the bottom of the ceiling fan base. There should be a \"knockout\" in the center of your ceiling fan base. Once you take out that centerpiece from the fan base, the light kit has a threaded part on top that goes into that centerpiece and is held there by the locknut. The wires also go through that center piece where they attach to the wiring for the fan. So whether you have a ceiling fan with a 3.5\" or 4\" base, it shouldn't really matter because the light kit is going to sit flush against that. Hopefully I didn't confuse you with all this. Hope this helps."

The miter saw's mounting brackets will work with any brand of miter saw. The brackets have a quick release feature that makes it possible to place a saw at any point on the rail, easily releasing the saw for increased portability. These brackets also allow for having two saws on the stand at the same time. The miter saw's material supports can be adjusted to wherever needed along the rail as well as up and down, which expands the possibilities of materials cut and saws used, and they boast flip up material cut stops. In addition, the feet on the tool mount are non-marring, keeping material from getting damaged.\" I don't think you will have a prolem at all and best of all, if you want to fold up the stand, the brackest have rubbe feet so you can sit it on a bench top table as well.

        "answer": "Hi Sara, I have 5 if these in my home, generally used in spaces that don't see a lot of action, like the garage interior and the pantry. The bulb senses movement as soon as we open the door into the space... The doors are all about 5-8 feet away from each bulb. I do have these bulbs in a car port too, and because they're up inside a lamp housing, the sensors are somewhat blocked. For those ones, you need to be within 4-5 feet for the sensors to work. For direct overhead placement, as long as the bulb isn't housed up inside a shade/cover, it will go off in 6-8 feet range."

I had a complete section (series) of mine go out, but the ones that weren't on that particular series still worked for awhile. They have since all gone out. Without the lights, they are still very pretty, but, with the lights they are really cool. I wish they sold replacements. Hope this helps. Cheers!!"

I wouldn't put insulation up against these lights because I believe there not rated. They do make covers out of flame retardantI rock wool type material . They are very pricey. In my situation my lights were installed in a 2nd floor where the air space is vented . So I built air tight boxes that went over the top of them . Or the heat / AC would've been sucked out. So i built boxes out of 1/2\" Owens Corning FOAMULAR board. That I got at home depot. A 1/3 of the cost of the premade covers they sell for this aIpplication . I bought it in a 1/2\" plywood size sheet. I made sure that my light were set dead center of the joists. I cut pieces to make boxes. 18\" L x 18\" H x 15\" W. I siliconed then screwed them together like if it were wood. Siliconed the seems and let dry. I placed them over the cans cutting a slit for the electric wire and siliconed them down over the light to the drywall . Then I spray foamed the edges and the hole made for the electric wire. Totally air tight . Very inexpensive to do . Hope this helps you."

The two most important bits of information are: 1) the diameter of the blade and, 2) the diameter for the arbor which fits in the hole in the middle of the blade. For this Oldham blade these dimensions are: 5-1/2\" blade diameter and 5/8\" arbor diameter. You can check the instruction manual for your saw to find these dimensions. If you don't have the manual, you can go to: www dot ryobitools dot com/catalog/power_tools/all_saws (replace the word dot with periods and no spaces). Check the Service and Support link for your model, or go to the web page for your model, and you may find a link there for the manual, or the specifications for your model. Good luck."

        "answer": "I assume that the yellow section you refer to is the cutting head. If the head is locked down, it really shouldn't move. Assuming that the gears, chains and bearing are okay, my intuition would be that you're doing too big of a cut in a single pass or this is a first pass on a board that has too much thickness variation. If that doesn't seem to be the case, I'd bet it's worn out bearings. I don't use that machine anymore, but I always have a spare set of bearing because that go out fairly frequently. If I recall, they aren't too expensive and you can easily replace them yourself if you're somewhat mechanically inclined. You should be able to visually inspect them. Instead of be perfectly round they become somewhat oblonged."

There is extra space at the top of it, and the 2.1 is no doubt the thickness. This means that the light fits in a square of about 7 inches by 7 inches. This means that the radius of an inscribed circular figure is 3.5 inches.

I only use my gun to solder two pieces of wire together so I've never really used the cutting tip. I will add this: The gun is of exceptional value. I have another just like it that I've had for almost 40 years but it never came with the carrying case and it still is going strong."

Have you thought of leveraging your current landscape lighting system. If your landscape lights are already turn on/off, then that would be the most effective way to do it. Its way easier and cheaper than to use the standard 120V transformer. Your landscape transformer outputs 12V AC. You need 12V DC for the LED. I recommend you get one of these to get the conversion done. It is a very small device so makes it easier to hide. 1/3 the cost of buying the transformers and a timer to control it (or worst, trying to find an outlet for the transformer). You can get it from Amazon. http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SGMW4K8 A demo is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJzarYlOnPc?"

My dog don't like either so i have it done at the vets office. Sorry, hopefully this helps somewhat."

Make sure you get an air drier for your air line. This is a great little compressor, but if you're plasma cutting, you're probably doing other things too so I would put the money to a larger 60-80 gallon 10+ cfm compressor which is much better suited for garage tool use. I use this little compressor for everything though (blowing sprinkler lines, small media blasting cabinet etc.) I'm always amazed at what this little thing can do.

I work in heavy manufacturing and this light has been submerged in water up to about 10 ft without any ill effects. It also sees lots of dusty environments and still works great. The only knock on it I have is one the high lumen setting the battery only lasts about 2-3 hours.

I'd google the watts customer service number if you needed to find out for sure. But looking at their specs, the biggest difference between DET and PLT series appears to be the DET is made in the USA, while the PLT is made in Taiwan. There are a few internal design differences and max pressure differences, but nothing a normal homeowner would worry about for residential usage. As far as the psi goes, the pre-charge really means nothing. You should adjust that pressure to match the pressure on the house side of your regulator (cold/resting pressure, ie water heater not running and relieve the overpressure with a quick run of both faucets before testing). Usually should be around 30-50 psi, depending on who you talk to. Which is likely why Watts set it around 40. So check your house pressure and adjust accordingly. You might need to adjust your regulator, but either way make the expansion tank match the house pressure."

        "question": "to 73 degrees and it kicks the motor on and repeats this many times. Can't be good for the motor. Any solutions.",
        "answer": "When you set the thermostat to the approximate temperature of the room (as detected by the internal thermometer of the thermostat), and are in the Auto mode, the cooler will switch on and off every time that temperature goes up a degree or two. If you don't like the recycling rate, turn the thermostat up a few degrees in the Auto mode and it will usually come on less often. However, this recycling is not doing much damage to the fan motor of your evaporative cooler so long as the belt is in good shape and set properly and the shaft of the squirrel cage fan is properly oiled. The belt should have about two inches of play at a point halfway between the motor pulley and the squirrel cage fan pulley. The fan shafts should be oiled at the beginning of the cooling season, sometime halfway through the cooling season, and at the end of the cooling season. Only a few drops of 3 in 1 or similar oil is need each time. Assuming you do not have sealed bearings on this shaft, there is an oil hole on each end of the shaft with a little spring loaded lid on them. At the end of the season, be sure that the pads and inside of the cooler are COMPLETELY dry before covering it to avoid rust. At the start of the season, with the power off, turn the large pulley on the fan shaft to ensure that it is free and turns easily before turning on the fan. If the fan is stuck, it will most likely burn out the motor. The motor is designed to start and stop as often as necessary and these starts and stops don't cause much wear unless the fan belt is set wrong. It is very similar to a refrigerator or air conditioner which cycles on and off when temperature changes are needed and will last many years doing so. Both are just motors."

        "answer": "Just an FYI - I am not a plumber - although I do most of my own plumbing. This was not the most difficult thing to install - however a lot of thought in to how to install it had to go in. Most plumbers who I showed it to thought I was wasting my money and it seemed as if they thought that well -if you can afford one of those than you can afford the $500 for me to install it. I installed it (and my entire water filter system in less than 4 hours - but I had to use all copper since that is the code here). Most water systems enter the house on different size pipes. At first I thought ours was 1\" - but I am glad I checked and saved the return charge - since ours was only \" however - most that I have seen are 3/4\" or 1\" pipes I decided to add this to the end of our water filtration system (since most of the water goes through there) and I made sure to installed a union fitting onto both ends in case I need to remove it for repair or replacement. Both ends of the brass fitting are threaded (I guess in case you need to remove it you don't have to un-solder it). As for the ADT pulse system - I am assuming that as long as you get the one that z-wave - than that should work. I can't say for sure since I don't use ADP (hate monthly charges) and use the Mi Casa Verde VeraLite Home Controller (http://www.amazon.com/Mi-Casa-Verde-VeraLite-Controller/dp/B007005364/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389557420&sr=8-1&keywords=Mi+Casa+Verde+VeraLite+Home+Controller)"

        "answer": "This will block the air flow from a forced air heat vent. They come in different sizes for different size vents. Order one that fits the vent(s) you have. You can purchase a smaller one to block only a partial vent. However, they are not very strong magnetically, so if there is any air pressure at all, it could be ineffective. The more vents you have blocked, the more pressure you have in the system. If you are blocking a lot of vents, it might be better to turn down/off the heater altogether and use an area heater for the area you need the heat. Another solution is to buy an adjustable heat vent that has a lever that you manually adjust the air flow for one vent. Warning of caution though, don't block more than 50% of you vents, this will cause too much pressure and possibly cause a problem blower motor or blow a hole in the the ducting, both of which can cost a lot of money to fix. Even worse, over working the blower motor and backing up the heat in the heater could cause a fire."

        "question": "Can this be connected to both faucet and fridge ice maker? will this provide enough pressure for the fridge?",
        "answer": "I got this! Yes, it can be connected and I will explain the process below. It's fine for fridge pressure, but depending on how your ice maker operates will determine how the ice cubes end up. My Frigidaire has a timer that will open up the water line for about 30 seconds, then close it no matter what. If the tank on the RO is low, this results in a couple smaller ice cubes for one or two batches. No big deal, just wanted to make you aware of it. Now, to connect the RO to an ice maker, I have an easier (and cheaper) solution than what Watts offers. Amazon sells most of the parts, but you'll probably end up having to buy the rest from your local hardware store. However, I do recommend that before you follow the process below, install the RO first and use it for a couple days to make sure there aren't any leaks. Once you're confident the RO is up-and-running properly, then you can go ahead and connect your icemaker. First, decide what type of line you want to run from the RO to the fridge. You can't use copper (because it affects the cleanliness of the RO water), so you can use either polyethylene tubing (the thin stuff that uses compression fittings) or a flexible PVC/stainless line (with metal connectors on either end). Take my advice and go with the PVC option...it's less likely to leak. Besides your supply line, you're going to need a 1/4\" Tee with Quick Connect fittings, a 1/4\" shut-off valve with Quick Connect fittings, and about a foot of 1/4\" polyethylene tubing. I found them all on Amazon, but they'll probably be a little cheaper at a hardware store. Links to the tee and the valve are below for visual reference. http://www.amazon.com/Watts-PL-3003-Push-Tee-4-Inch/dp/B000BVMY9S/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1370103689&sr=8-9 http://www.amazon.com/Watts-PL-3011-Push-Valve-4-Inch/dp/B000BO585M/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&qid=1370103689&sr=8-13 Finally, and this is the hardest item to find, you need a Quick Connect adapter. This will allow you to easily adapt a Quick Connect fitting to a threaded 1/4 connector. In my experience, smaller hardware stores (Ace, True Value, etc.) that sell Culligan water filters also sell these connectors. Amazon has them, but not through Prime... http://www.amazon.com/Culligan-Qc-ak-Quick-Connect-Adapter/dp/B002T4PEC4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1370104179&sr=8-1 Once you've got all your parts, turn off the water supply to the RO. Turn on the faucet and let the tank completely drain. Once that's done, cut the blue line marked \"faucet\" that runs from the top right of RO system to the faucet. Doesn't matter where you cut it, just somewhere in the middle. Take the cut ends of the blue \"faucet\" line and reconnect them to the two ends on the tee quick connect adapter. Then, cut 6\" of polyethylene tubing and insert one end into the top portion of the tee. Now, insert the other end of the polyethylene tubing into one end of the Quick Connect shut-off valve, and your Culligan Quick Connect adapter into the other end of the shut-off valve. Screw on your flexible PVC tubing, run to the back of the fridge, connect, and that's it! When you open up the water line for the first time after it's connected to the icemaker, make sure the shut-off valve you just installed is closed. Let the tank fill up completely, then open the shut-off valve to let water flow to the icemaker. Check for leaks and as long as you did everything right, you'll be enjoying incredible ice in no time."

        "answer": "The base is designed for an older Delta unisaw or shaper without a cast iron base (20 3/4 X 20 3/4 inches). The unisaw actually sits down into the frame and rest on the four corner base supports. The unisaw does not need anything to hold it down...it just sits inside the frame. The 50-289 does not work with an old old unisaw or shaper with a cast iron base or with the newer 36-LX52 Delta unisaw. You have to buy the 50-257 mobile base to fit the new dual front handle unisaw. I cut a piece of 1/2 inch plywood and placed it into the frame for the saw to sit on so the sawdust would not fall on the floor, but would be trapped inside as if the saw was sitting on the concrete. The foot pedal when depressed for moving stays in the depressed position until you release it with your toe. It works very well and is engaged by simply using your toe to raise or lower the saw. I am very pleased with it."

        "answer": "Not as such. It uses regular old 1/2\" MPT on the inlet and outlet. So, if you used flexible 1/2\" NPT lines to plumb it in, it would be pretty simple to unbolt the lines, and unmount it from the hanger and empty it out. There is no easily accessible drain. Note, since you can't drain it, unmounting it means you need to be able to get it off the wall hooks, and it weighs a bit more than 70lbs when full of water."

        "question": "can this be used to sharpen knives",
        "answer": "here's the thing--you can \"sharpen\" with basically anything abrasive that's harder than the steel you're sharpening. Aluminum oxide and silicon carbide abrasives won't work as well on \"super steels\" (e.g. CPM S30V, which contain vanadium carbides, pretty hard stuff that really only cuts quickly on diamond or cubic boron nitride) but unless you're going for a mirror polish anything harder than steel will work just fine. The soft backing on micro mesh is great for some applications, and it could give you an interesting 'convex' shape (like using a buffing wheel or belt grinder) if you really work on your technique, but I think you'll find that something like 3M (or other brand) lapping 'films' work much better for maintaining a consistent angle. Sandpaper can work in a pinch, but it loads too much to use dry and it's pretty messy when wet, I'd recommend the \"film\" sheets over paper if you're serious about starting a real sharpening routine."

The best cheapest place to get replacements is Sears. They sell craftsman individual bits #3 for around $2.00. That's where I've gone, I usually buy 2-3 at a time. If you're making money with this tool then buying the bits pay for them selves with one job that you do."

I was able to slide the leg over about an inch to find good wood for the screws."

These suits are designed to stop liquids, and as far as I can tell are the same suits being used by MSF (Doctors without Borders) in africa. The suit is only a part of the solution, it must be used with 2 layers of gloves, proper eye protection, and proper mask. Just as important as the suit itself is proper knowledge of its use. dressing and undressing in the proper order is even more important than the materials the protective clothing are made of. MSF has a website with free download of books they have published (in english and french) with every bit of information you will ever need on control of hemmoragic fevers such as ebola. It is much better to buy several cheap suits that can be disposed of if torn or overly contaminated than it is to spend a lot of money on one big fancy one."

The flame battery never seems to need replacing and I have had them since Christmas. To answer your question, I had them out during our recent California heat wave about two weeks ago and no, they did not melt. But then they are in a shaded area. Hope this helps...you cannot go wrong with these candles. I plan on buying more for the holidays for myself and maybe gifts as well."

(Just dip the bit in a can of water.) If you find that the bit is seizing, sharpen the bit or slow down the RPM's a little. \"Cool Tool\" is an excellent lubricant for aluminum. Regardless of the speed you use. The bottom of the hole will need to be deburred. Use a fine metal file."

It comes with self tapping screws to complete the rail connection. There is a truss wire with connectors that run from one corner of the frame to another. The chain link provided is enough to cover the full width so you have to size it to fit the size of your frame by simply \"unscrewing\" one link row. There are connectors that hold the chain link to the frame. It comes with the gate side of 2 hinges. Unfortunately, they did not fit the pole side of the hinges that I bought, so I had to buy the gate side of the hinges to fit. Finally, it includes a gate latch. I'm happy with it since I could make it the exact size that I needed for my garden. Hope this helps."

        "answer": "I've not used them at that distance, but it should be fine. A k-type thermocouple produces about 41 microvolts/degree C. A typical op-amp (input for the PID controller) has an input bias current of say 45nA (for the LM324). 1000 ft of 24 gauge copper wire has a resistance of about 26 ohms. 45nA x 26 ohms is about 1.1 microvolts. That's about a 2% error for a 500 foot run (there and back) of really small wire. So 60ft shouldn't be a problem. Your error for 60 feet would be closer to 0.34%. Besides all this, the PIDs are self calibrating, so if the PID works as expected, it should be able to calibrate for a large portion of that anyway."

I'm sure I'm only carrying a fraction of the weight it can hold. Plus I have a board I designed to sit on the second tier & use it as a table top for my stuff. It's easy to haul around & if you are limited on space in your car or if you're carrying a lot of weight in it, I like the fact that I can break it down in three pieces to fit or so that I can lift it into my car. I would recommend this box, and think it would definitely fit your needs & make things easier for you as well."

        "answer": "Hi Shecky, I just took some pics but Amazon won't let me upload so I will have to tell you exactly. The lengthwise measurement for my plate is 5 1/4 in. the small screws begin apprroximately 1/4 in down and over to the corners. The width is 2 1/2 inches. I applied them to limestone rock so the were predrilled with tiny holes. What I used in addition to that was some Loktite-available at any hardward store to secure the plate. Love it, still looks beautiful and works great."

        "question": "How wide it the opening you cut in the downspout to install this?",
        "answer": "The vertical downspout must be cut completely in half about 1/2\" minimum above the height of the rain barrel or where the filler hose from the downspout to the rain barrel will enter the rain barrel. Some rain barrels fill from the top, and others from somewhere on the side of the barrel. I cut my downspout about 4 1/2\" above the barrel to make room for the downspout diverter to fit above the height of the barrel since my barrel fills both ways and I wasn't sure if I wanted to fill from the top or side. Then you cut an equal amount ( or what is needed to refit the lower part of the downspout) off the lower downspout you had cut off to attach to the bottom of the diverter, so the excess water can run past the diverter when the barrel is full so the water will drain out into the yard as before the diverter was installed. Without the second cut the lower downspout will drag the ground when you try to reinstall the lower downspout unless the opening was way off the ground originally. If the upper cut is too low, the water won't run uphill to fill the rain barrel and the water will all run down the downspout as if the diverter wasn't there. I guess you can't make it too high unless it's so high the hose won't reach the opening in the barrel. In all, I cut a section of about 8 1/2\" out of the original downspout to make room for the diverter and it's about four inches above my rain barrel. I didn't need to use the adapters that come with the diverter kit, but that could add as much as 3 inches to the length of the diverter once completed so assemble the diverter the way it's going to be installed in the downspout and measure. That will be the minimum amount you need to cut out of the existing downspout to make it fit. As long as it's about the filler in the rain barrel but will still reach, it will work just fine. Hope this helps."

        "answer": "well, how sharp you can get your knife roughly depends on how good you are at using a sharpening stone but remember too, that this is a field sharpening stone - mainly used for touch-ups - getting burrs off your blade, etc. Initial sharpening should be done at home where you would probably have a larger stone or a series of stones to get that perfect edge. Honing Oil is your best bet but yes, I have seen ppl use water and even spit on the stone to get it moist. Hope this helps"

I replaced the socket with a standard E19 socket. The other limiting factors are the diameter of the shade opening (small) and its depth. I was able to get 40W equiv LED ceiling fan bulb to fit. If you go that way, be sure to get a bulb rated for enclosed fixtures. In short, it's possible, but difficult. The manufacturer needs to update the light assembly since a 75W or 100W halogen uses up to 10X what an equivalent LED bulb would, has a much shorter life, and produces unecessary heat."

This is a link http://www.heath-zenith.com//data/manuals/595-5578-08.pdf to a PDF of the manual for the type I installed which I think may be very similar in the installation to that pictured in customer S. Pike's question. Adjustment of the motion sensor and other settings were important to my satisfaction and may be to S. Good luck!"

        "answer": "Hope I can help. The gate opener only opens and closes the gate stopping a point that you determine. it will not move from these settings. If you are referring to a latch and lock system the normal kind will not work with the opener. Yes you could have a normal latch that would close and secure the gate but it would have to be opened manually to open the gate. There is a electromagnetic gate latch that works well but you can only use it if your using normal ac current, the solar version will not take the load of this type of gate latch and will run the battery down faster than the solar panel can charge it. I have no latch on my gate but put a 2x6 piece of wood on my fence and the gate pushes up against the wood to keep a tight fit when closed. For security if i'm away from home at length I just wrap a chain and lock around the gate when its closed. Its a great opener but I have several helpful suggestions that the company does not explain for security, and also ease of installation if you are interested."

        "answer": "Hello there, If i remember correctly, this is installed with a steel bracket approx about 4-6 inches apart. One important factor i should mention about this product is the coupling of the main unit (the ceiling piece you can see here) with the bracket (the big circle portion at the top). If you'll notice from the last picture, about where the cylinder meets the \"dome\" for the lighting, you have to hold up the light and attach these onto the bracket. It may not look complicated but it was hard doing it by myself (as the light portion is quite heavy even without the crystal bulbs attached). Be aware you will have to attach the electrical along with holding up the light and finding the holes to the bracket all at the same time! Buy a strand of metal wire to attach through the holes during the process to hold up the light. Additionally, be aware of the hydrogen bulbs you place in the lamp. Make sure you buy lower wattage (and not the big bulky LED energy saving bulbs) as they may/may not fry the little transformer in the light. Hope this helps!"

As long as you have top space for \"two tracks'' I don't see why you can't put two together... one from the left and one from the right. The only issue I can see would be how the magnets attach together at the middle. The would retract each other so maybe a small metal plate in the middle. If you are looking for long term or deal with pets and children going in and out, then these are not a good choice. They will be flimsy at the bottom.

But the bench will hold hundreds of pounds and is very stable (I have stood on it - 220 lbs). This workbench is considered a mobile workbench, and is no match for a heavy metal tool stand. And how do you define a large saw, 12\" comercial table saw, or power miter saw? Say the saw weighs 50 pounds. If you can clamp or bolt the your saw to the top, in my opinon it will hold the weight and stress of cutting standard wood pieces. If you are trying to cut railroad ties, it is probably not the right bench."

        "answer": "I used this product to successfully and securely mount a new thermostat horizontally in place of the original thermostat that was mounted vertically on a metal junction box that was attached to a wall stud. The package contains two plastic coverplates and one metal adapter. The metal adapter is the critical piece; it converts a vertical mount to a horizontal mount. I attached the metal adapter to the metal junction box and then attached the new thermostat to the metal adapter. Neither of the two plastic cover plates were compatible with my new thermostat so they could not be used. Since the new thermostat was smaller than the original thermostat I am left with an unsightly mess of unpainted drywall that the plastic coverplate was intended to cover. Some repainting was required to finish the job. I am not a tradesman and do not do this for a living. I tried three different Honeywell coverplates and none of them was compatible with my new Honeywell thermostat. However, this coverplate at least provided a metal adapter that allowed the new thermostat to be mounted horizontally on a vertical junction box."

        "answer": "Having grown up on a farm in Minnesota and used heat tapes for most of my life, the answers from my own experiences include: 1. The tape can be wrapped around plastic (PVC) pipe. 2. You have to insulate the pipe wrapped with the heat tape using foam purchased by the foot or in 6-10 foot lengths. The insulation can come in 3/4 inch or 1 inch size and you probably need the 1 inch foam insulation to cover not only the pipe but the heat tape as well. 3. The tape is sealed and will most likely get wet at some time and I've never seen this causing any problems with the tape operation. Keep in mind that this a very low voltage system and does not get burning hot, only the slightest bit warm. For that reason, the heat has to be held in just like you would when laying in bed on a cold night, you bundle up and keep the blanket over you to keep warm."

If memory serves, it would be ~26 combos to try 3x3x3 -(1). If your combo was 555, the. You would try 455, 655, 545, 645, 545, etc. I would also call Master Lock to see what they say or just get new locks."

You cam use different shank sizes without changing out parts like other models since it has a standard chuck. It also doesn't bog down like other models. The handle doesnt get hot in your hand either and its mot as bulky as it looks Its quite comfortable. This is my third dremel brand rotery tool. The last two were high end dremels and this one is the best I have ever owned. I use mine for cutting/carving plastic, wood, metal and have used it on bone and it works great. I did replace the foot switch with a router speed control so i can swirch it on by hand a adjust the speed without getting a cramp in my leg. Hope this helps."

The Dremel tool has a 1/8 inch shank which is far too small for these bits. These bits are a great deal if you have a drill press. You have to squirt water on the bit and cutting surface while drilling to keep thee bits from getting over heated. If the bit gets over heated it will lose it's temper and the diamond dust cutting edge will be lost."

The 3-bolt mounting system has a non removable hush cushion (splash guard), the EZ mounting system has a removable splash guard. There are no differences with the motors or performance. The EZ mount system is true to its name, it is indeed easier to work with than the 3 bolt system. Neither garbage disposal style is considered better than the other.

If you hold lighter things and want one that has more flexible holding features, then consider lesser expensive weaker models. My Rigid isn't the most adapting yet I'm totally comfortable beating hard on it (its also guaranteed not to break). I thought I might buy a cheaper second vice for holding small pipes and other round things for instance. After more than a year, I still have only the Rigid.

I've moved an upright piano on it successfully several times. It claims 800 lbs. maximum in the flat position, and if it were being used on a totally flat surface, that would probably work. I've used my new one as a hand truck, step stool, and 350 lbs. dolly with the upright handle, fully loaded. They are very serviceable."

From there you HAVE to connect the lights from the fused car circuit (or on additional external 1A fuse immediately after car battery) and NOT DIRECTLY (without the fuse) to the car battery as it may create fire if/when the + and - wires are accidentally short circuited (or + shorts to car metal that is always -).

        "answer": "This is unlikely due to the Stapler. I purchased this stapler to build one dozen acoustic panels for my home recording studio. I was building wooden frames wherein I can place insulation and hang them like pictures. To build the frames, I used \"furring strips\" from Lowes. I learned that at some parts of various strips, it was simply too tough for the staples to penetrate while in others there were no problems at all. Because I was building so many, I found it worth while to purchase an electric version of this. Even that was having difficulty punching in staples in some places. Notice though, that the 9/16\" will still penetrate, but just twist after some depth. It might make sense to get shorter staples; but that is no guarantee -- depending on what you're building. That said, the most likely reason the staples don't sink in fully is the wood is too dense. Furthermore, make sure to put weight on the back of the stapler as you fire off staples."

        "answer": "Ola Fee - Neither weatherproof or resistant, strictly indoors or protected from weather under a hood. It is a solid state computer board with a fan to control its temperature in a plastic box but as I think I remarked the fan is the feature that bothered me the most because it is already making noise like it will fail at any moment. I am in less than 25% humidity (And it is glorious!) for most of the year and so electronics and much else lasts much longer but I don't even leave this unattended or on while away/sleeping and having lived in high humidity most of my life I would think its lifetime would be shorter. I have an 8 year old or so Schumacher trickle charger (small solid state, supposedly a leave-it-on the battery \"smart\" charger however it works poorly and sometimes not at all on 6 V batteries; I am biased against Battery tender products based on what I have read from reliable sources in magazines and online. All I can say about this is that they have gotten the charge parameters right (including desulfating) to restore (some) run down batteries, maintain frequently used batteries to extend their life (a vehicle alternator does not do so), and it does so inexpensively. I no longer believe in the use of trickle chargers or battery maintainers - as long as the battery surface is kept clean from water-conducting material (I know, hard in LA) and electrolyte levels are maintained I would rather apply one of these for several hours before intended use (even after a year of inactivity) rather than try to \"maintain\" a battery. \"Auto Restorer\" magazine runs pretty good articles on this whole issue and you may be able to find relevant articles at a library or from a friend who subscribes. Best of luck."

        "question": "Where to mount (20' x 25' x 8' woodshop) - tools along 2 walls - workbench in center - mainly sanding dust..",
        "answer": "The most optimal spot is hanging from the ceiling near the long wall of a rectangular shop with the intake of the unit located at about 1/3 of the long wall and the exhaust pointing with the long wall towards the opposite corner of that long wall. This will provide the most efficient room circulation. You choose the mounting spot so that the direction of dust flow within the room is complementary to where you normally stand. In other words, you don't want to stand in a direct line between the dust source and the intake because that means your lungs filter the air before the air filter unit which is obviously bad. In general, you want to stand in a location that is downwind of the exhaust path of the collector. For sanding the above recommendation is still optimal overall however, I also recommend collecting most of the dust at the source with a downdraft table and vacuum because the dust is so fine, you don't want to transfer that dust around the room. You can also use a cheap smaller air filter unit (like a box fan with HVAC home filter duct tape to it) right next to your dusting station in tandem with the whole room system."

        "answer": "The SL1 Solar Security Light is IP56 rated. Waterproofing is rated by the IP (International Protection) system which consists of the letters IP followed by two digits. The first digit after IP ranks a products protection against solid objects. The second digit after the IP rates a products ability to protect against liquids. The FL1 Solar Floodlight is IP56 rated. IP56 means the light is protected against dust - limited ingress (no harmful deposit) and protected against strong jets of water e.g. for use on shipdecks - limited ingress permitted. This means it should be fine for use in a rainy or wet area. Just don't let anything solid hit it (hail, debris)."

These Quick Dam barriers are good and hold a lot of water for a long time. Ours are still intact and in place after 8 months. (Although we haven't had any torrential rain here in Central Pennsylvania for some time) I'll be very interested to see just how long they will last."

A couple-dollar adapter bought at any hardware store will cure your problem (take fixture with you so hardware store people know what you are talking about) or, you can update the outlet in your home that you want to use, with a new design outlet (not easy for untrained person to do and could be dangerous to try by yourself)."

        "answer": "These lamps are designed to emit their maximum lumens at specified voltages and amperages. A 3-D cell LED would be overdriven by the voltage and amperage of 4-D cells. It would be extremely bright for a very short amount of time. If you insist on using the LED, use only 3-D cells in the Mag Light, and use a dummy cell to take up the space. You can use another D cell, but cover both ends well with a non-conductive covering, then wrap the dummy cell in metal foil, so that you make a circuit from the end of the 3rd cell to the spring in the end cap. Now you have a 3-D cell Mag Light."

        "answer": "3. :-). It's got something to do with the density of the filter. The higher the number the more tiny the particles it can trap. However, this also cuts down on airflow and will cause your system to need to run harder or longer, which will raise your energy bills. My research into the matter suggested 11 or higher is for commercial/industrial needs. But 8 was deemed efficient enough / recommended for residential purposes. I hope that helps.

From experience with my device, it will in deed find studs behind plaster walls. In addition it will also find studs that are located in and around close proximity to electrical wiring and provide an audible warning when it senses that there is electrical wiring in close proximity to where you are searching for the studs. The beauty of this device is that it has specific settings on the front of the finder for normal depth, deep scanning, metal studs and a setting for detecting and finding electrical wiring.

I'm sure that it could be painted a different color although it is a PVC texture, so you would have to take it by a paint store and asked them what type of pay would stick to the texture of the PVC. I hope that your post turns out as well as mine, and hope that you get as many compliments as I have had about my post and light. By the way, I mounted my post over a 4 x 4 post to give it more strength which was a good idea. J Howell Jacksonville Florida"

The bottom of the side walls of the drawer slide on these. To install them, you'll probably have to use either a small hammer or the side of a hammer and it works best if you put a small piece of wood or something stiff and flat, even a putty knife between the glide and the hammer so you're actually distributing the load on the glide, otherwise the head of the tack in the glide will break through. If it does, you can still make the glide work by hammering the tack down with a nail set. Photo posted."

The 1.2 cu ft. says it all, basically the internal size is 1ft. in length X 1ft. in width X 1ft. in height . So measure your album with a 12 inch ruler and if it is longer than the ruler then it will not fit except if it is only slightly longer than the ruler and is placed diagonally in the safe. Even then it can only hold one album. No, you need something larger than a 1.2 cu ft. So the X125 - FORGET IT ENTIRELY as it is too small."

They are under an eve so they are out of direct rain, but they are out in the ocean mist and cold air. They appear to be very well sealed. There are two reasons I can think of why it is labeled for indoor use only. 1) The big metal heatsink on the back could give you a big electric shock if the bulb is wet to the base and you try to handle it. 2) it is not as well sealed as I think it is. But if you're careful and willing to take the risk, they light up the yard around my house extremely well."

I didn't even have the hose a year either. When I called them about it, the lady was rude. They do not back this product as they should and I manage an rv park. I won't recommend it to current or future tenants. I want my customers to return. They wouldn't even meet me halfway and refund half my money much less replace the hose. If you can use it without an extension cord, you will have a warranty but whether or not they will back it, is the question. I hope this helps.

        "answer": "I can't give an exact answer. In general, the intensity of a light decreases with the square of the distance from the light. In other words, if the distance from the light doubles, you divide the source intensity by 4. My back yard is about 1/2 acre, and this light throws out enough light so that you can see a person or animal anywhere in the yard. Subjectively, I would say the light is fairly \"bright\" for at least 100 feet; but, as mentioned earlier, the intensity drops off with distance. I've been pleased with this light. The only down side is that bulbs are very expensive."

        "answer": "Hi Ruth. Most all new Kohlers are a water saver style toilet, and are designed to deliver two types of flushes. First is the quick flush for urine, and that means you push down then quickly release the handle. Less water is used so there is a water savings over emptying the tank. Second flush type is for solids, and you simply hold down on the handle until the flush is complete. All the water in the tank is used, but the newer tanks are smaller, so less water is used compared to the toilets of the 50's and 60's. It's all about water savings. No one thinks to tell you, eh? Good luck on the flush from now on. ...Jeff..."

Because of that, I would use them with dimmable LEDs. Leviton's own documentation warns that using incandescent DIMMER switches with LED bulbs may result in inconsistent performance, and that they are not UL safety rated for use with LED bulbs. But this isn't really a dimmer switch, it's either on or off. Most of what I have read regarding using standard wall switches (incandescent) for LED bulbs only talk about performance loss at low power, not about safety issues. To be safe, though, I would ask an electrician, or consult the manufacturer's (lighting fixture) documentation."

The leaks that both of our units developed were directly across from the inlet from the dishwasher, where the unit housing had cracked. Every time the dishwasher discharged into the unit, it would leak - this happened to two separate, identical units, both of which had to replaced within one year of their installation."

        "answer": "Obviously, it must be selected for 110V operation as 220v would burn it out rather dramatically. But 50 Hz is the frequency in Europe, 220V here in the US is still 60 Hz. In fact house power arrives as a 220V (60 Hz) circuit that is split into 2 x 110V lines (still 60 Hz) - there is no change in frequency. Secondly, there are only certain types of motors which are affected by frequency, ...these typically being so-called 'synchronous motors'. I've run saws from my generator all day - which uses a substantially square wave output (true sine wave generation is more expensive) - no problem. A power transformer by the way does not change the frequency - unless it is also a converter having batteries and active circuits for regenerating the sine wave output. I'm an electronic engineer by trade. Hope that helps."

        "answer": "Sandblasting a door would probably be the best way to remove old paint, it will get it down to the grain rather quickly and you won't disfigure the frame. If you sand blast it, you will think it's never been painted before. You can get a blast tank at Harbor Freight on sale for under a hundred dollars. You will need a good compressor, at least a 60 gallon. I would recommend getting a Two Stage compressor like an Ingersoll Rand as they will last a long time and have plenty of power for all types of air tool applications. They are pricey, about $1000. Or just pay someone else to sand blast the door for you, probably $80. If the door is off the hinges this will scrape it down, but anything 3D will be problematic. If you hit a nail or a screw in the door it will chip the blade and leave a high trail where the chip is. The only other way to do something like this would be to get a wire brush for a drill or angle grinder. A Cubic Zirconium Flop Disc isn't too bad either, they are about $13, they would shred any paint off but they are going to leave spirals in the wood. I've seen guys use a Heat Gun and a Scraper to heat the paint and just scrape it off too. Good Luck with your project."

        "question": "Does it realy have true variable speed?",
        "answer": "It has variable speed but bear in mind that the speed is controlled by the trigger. The closer you pull the trigger to the drill body, the faster the chuck will turn. However, If by \"true\", you mean is there a dial where you can set the exact speed ie. 300 rpm or 350 rpm then the answer is no. This feature is more likely found on rotary tools like Dremels, some drill presses and milling machines. I am not aware of any variable speed hand drills that have scales which would enable you to dial in exact speeds. If exact speed is a necessity, then you might want to research rotary tools, bench tools which have a dial that can be set or tools that have a digital display that tells you how fast the chuck is turning. Additionally, I don't know what materials you plan to drill. This drill's range is 0-550 rpm which may or may not be suitable for your intended purpose. I recommend that you study the numerous drill speed and feed guides available on the web to determine if this drill has the best speed range for your project or whether you need a drill with a higher rpm range. It may also be helpful to do a search of materials, material thicknesses, hole sizes, suggested bit lubricants and drill types to see what tradespeople and manufacturers recommended. You can easily ruin costly materials by drilling them at the wrong speed or quickly dull expensive drill bits by using the wrong bit for the material, exerting too much pressure on the bit or not using lubricant. Talk to people who have drilled the same or similar materials. Ask to see if they have any scrap that you can use for test purposes. There is no single drill suitable for all types of drilling. Br prepared to experiment before finally figuring out what works best for you."

If you're planning on a permanent install, it won't be the most attractive product. But, you should be ok with this as a temporary protectant. It's pretty sticky but shouldn't damage vinyl headliners. On the mouse-fur or velour type headliners, don't press it on too hard and you should still be ok. When you remove it, you'll probably have fibers attached to the sticky but it shouldn't pull it bald. You might also consider using Glad Cling Wrap from your local grocery store. It's similar but thinner. Might be easier to just remove the trim and take the headliner out. Good luck."

        "answer": "I bought the same product. It has a very new feature: small white plastic safety child-proof barriers that move into the interiors of the slots when nothing is plugged in. These barriers move aside when you push a plug into the socket. Sometimes you have to push the plug a little harder than normal in order to get the two plastic barriers to move aside. Note that most modern plugs now have one blade that is wider than the other and sockets like this one have one slot that is likewise wider than the other. This is a safety feature. The wider blade is for the neutral side of the circuit and the narrower blade is for the hot side. Because of the different sizes of the blades the plug cannot be put into the socket incorrectly. I think that when you tried to plug the lamp back in you were unknowingly trying to put the wider blade into the narrower slot. Turn the plug one half turn (180 degrees) and it should fit properly into the socket. Push firmly to move the safeties aside."

However, for door hinges, you could also consider using a white lithium grease (it comes is a spray also), which doesn't dry. True, it might ultimately collect a dust and grime, but it might also provide longer protection than silicone. That said, I've used this silicone spray on my door hinges and found it worked well at cutting out squeaking and making the door easier to open/close.

A standard battery at half volume will last most of the day. This unit does NOT charge the batteries while plugged in.

        "answer": "This is a very sturdy stand- I think it could support 140 lbs without any problem. You will have to drill new holes in the top as the predrilled holes will doubtless be in the wrong position for your mill. The mobile wheel mechanism on the base tilts the table when it is in the moveable position so you will want to be sure to anchor your tool so it doesn't overbalance."

Your question prompted me to get off my butt to go sit in the chair (thank you for that!) and adjust it to a good spot just to see if it might work, and it appears it will work great; however without actually attempting to stitch under it I can't say for sure. The magnifying it provides looks like it would be absolutely great for doing cross stitch or other close up needlework!

        "answer": "I replaced mine with an LED, but it wasn't as simple as replacing the bulb, and most likely voided the lifetime warranty. The Halogens were too hot and too yellow for my tastes. If you turn the halogen light on for 5 minutes, you'll need oven mitts to take the globe off. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find an LED bulb with an E12 base that output anything close to the lumens required to be the main light source for a bedroom. The easiest of my solutions involved removing the halogen base, soldering the light wires to an led array, and attaching the led array to the light mount. I chose an LED array from Seoul Semiconductors, product number SMJD2V16W1P3-CA, because it doesn't require an external led driver as it's all built into the board of the led. The 70mm circumference ended up being a perfect fit. The lights run much cooler and are brighter than with the supplied halogen. Since the dimmer supplied with the light is meant for halogens, it's not ideal for the LEDs, and there's some noticeable flicker at low dimming levels. I am slightly concerned that the light mount plate may not provide an adequate heat sink for the led array, but I haven't had any issues yet."

        "answer": "Cap refers to a \"Cap Crimper\", if you look above the wire cutters and the wrench part of the pliers there is an inset half-circle on each of the pliers near the top, it allows you to crimp a cable, so if you work with cabling a lot such as co-axial cable, you can finish new cables by using this part of the tool on the end of the connector so it stays firmly attached to the cable. If you are still unsure what I am describing, look up \"cable crimping\" and you will see what I mean. Hope this helped."

The two plates set up a blackbody radiation cavity which enhances the transfer of heat from the absorber surface to the fluid (patent pending feature). The thermal conductance losses vary greatly depending on irradiance, collector core temperature and ambient conditions. We use the maximum equilibrium temperature difference between the core and ambient as a measure of panel efficiency which is approximately 220 deg. F, however overall system maximum equilibrium temperature difference is much lower. Thank You, Heliatos Solar"

In effect, it doesn't need an external thermostat as the switch functions like a thermostat in the sense that there is a temperature range at which the unit will automatically turn on and off triggered by an internal thermostat. Set at its highest point, the unit remains on and throwing heat. Set the switch anywhere in between, and the unit cycles on and off according to the temperature determined by the internal thermostat depending on how far you turn the switch. As evidence of this internal thermostat, you should also note, that this internal thermostat turns on the unit after you shut it down so as to cool down the coil automatically."

Using a 4-mode 180-lumen LED and fully telescoping lens, this powerful headlamp can shine light to distances of 550 feet when used on high.

The ELV4 easily fits into a wall-mounted junction box. According to compatibility information if your system falls within these specs it's supposed to work. I used mine on radiant ceiling heat.

You can build a stand or buy one that has a top large enough to fit the Excelsior. I recommend bolting it down, and using bolts and nuts to level it. Leveling is not a critical as with a machine lathe, but is still best practice. This lathe has enough gusto to turn pieces large enough to walk it around if they are out of balance. Not just with chunks missing, but also pieces not yet dry, with differential amounts of water through the piece. Out of balance pieces can be a little dangerous."

        "answer": "Its advertised as a 7 inch buffer but since there is no guard that limits what size you can use you have a broad range of size to chose from. The arbor (threaded portion that holds the backing pad to the buffer) is a standard thread and size so almost any backing pad should fit. It also comes with a lock nut to hold backing pads that are not threaded onto the arbor. The biggest thing is dont skimp on the backing pad. Crappy backing pads can come apart when in use causing injury or damage to whatever your working on. Backing pads that dont hold the pad securely can slip and also leave a rubber skid mark and/or scratches on your work as well. The backing pad that comes with the buffer is one of the types that can slip and scar your work. GET RID OF IT! Other reviewers have had problems with the included backing pad as well. I suggest Meguiar's Self-Centering 8-Inch Rotary Buffer Backing Plate. Its sold on Amazon for $20 and has served me well for numerous jobs with this buffer. It has a velcro attachment for any front pad you want and holds it securely. The material you chose for the front pad will vary with whatever you are doing."

        "answer": "I am not sure about a beach, I do know the cart is fantastic. Whenever I go out with it, several people always ask, where did you get that?! It is extremely sturdy with lots of room. I am not sure how it would do on beach sand though. Probably very well with a little extra effort. You may have to actually share the carry burden with your beach buddy to get to that perfect beach lounging spot. But on all other surfaces? It's fantastic. Cannot go wrong with this cart. I did have one problem when I ordered, it was delivered missing 2 small pieces of hardware. Sandusky overnighted them to me and it was super easy to put together."

I never cleaned the inside and wouldn't recommend doing it because of the sensitive electronics inside. I would vacuum the outside. The units should not be painted. The only time the cover needs to be removed is to replace the 9 V. battery every 1-2 years. Removal instructions are imprinted on the cover. The cover twists off so the battery can be replaced and is held by a wiring harness and connector. The connector does not have to be removed from the cover to change the battery.

        "answer": "1) if you want to use the dimming function, be sure to use dimmable lights. I use these with dimmable incandescent and led bulbs. 2) yes. This kit comes with a primary and an auxiliary switch. The auxiliary sends a signal to the primary switch to tell it what to do. If you want to add a third switch, you'll need another auxiliary switch. Also, note that the wiring for this kit is different from a traditional 3-way switch. This video helped me a lot: http://youtu.be/2vguVa58PGI To extend to a 4-way setup, you'll wire the second auxiliary switch the same way you wire the first auxiliary. I bought about 8 of these kits and found that the primary switch on two of the kits didn't work properly with the auxiliary. If you follow the video and don't get a proper result (e.g. Flickering lights when you try to use the auxiliary switch) don't burn a lot of time trying to make it work. Exchange it. I recommend practicing with a basic single switch setup first, then graduate to a secondary switch, then add the third switch. Troubleshooting the entire setup out of the gate can ruin your weekend!"

        "answer": "In short, No. That said, it depends on the LED light. Most dimmable LED's start to flicker when they get below 20% of full brightness. I have Switch Bulbs on a Maestro and they begin to flicker at about 15 to 20% of full brightness, it's dim but not to the level incandescent can get. I also have Phillips & Switch bulb (2 connected lamps) on a Diva dimmer and the Phillips flickers well before the Switch. Now I co have several Cree Recesses lights (Home Depot) on a Diva dimmers and they dim down right to candle light level. All the switches I use are designed for CFL & LED. The fact that the Cree recessed lights go all the way down to that barely on level I think has more to do with the lights LED electronics rather than the Maestro or Diva dimmer. I haven't used enough variety to be suitably knowledgeable in a definitive manner. Hope this helps."

You can see if you need it after the 800 grit grind because the marble chips are starting to \"slick up\" and the concrete around the chips is still dull. (Make sure you wipe up all the old grit before going to the next grit. I use a clean damp rag each time.) Follow the instruction included or go on-line, as to how you mix this stuff, how you apply it and how long you let it set. I'm pretty sure its caustic so follow safety procedures as they recommend. After the densifier, continue through the grits and when finished, the sealer goes on last to close the pores of the floor to make it more stain resistant. I have seen certain comments on line that indicates it can dull the finished gloss a little so try it before going whole hog on the floor."

        "answer": "Be sure the QL-1000 quartz light is unplugged before you try putting the quartz light in. The little ceramic block is the receptor, and it will give way from a little bit of pressure. In other words, one end of the quartz light gets pushed in (about 2 mmm), before the other end is maneuvered in. Don't try to slide the quartz light in like a fluorescent light. There won't be enough room for it to go in. The trick, is angling the light in, and pushing one side in before the other side starts to fit. I go through those little lights about every week (assuming I am doing a lot of shoots all day long, 12 to 16 hours a day), or once every month (assuming I am doing about three shoots a month, 8 to 12 hours per shoot). The real problem with the QL-1000 is not putting the light in, it's tolerating the whirr of the built-in fan."

So if you need a definitive answer, then I would say \"NO\" ! With a little luck, however, it may work fine. Just remember that these lamps draw so little current, that you could leave these in a fixture that stays on all day and night & still will use less electricity than an incandescent bulb burning only 8 to 10 hours a day.

        "answer": "It might but probably not as as simple as it sounds its not a yes or no answer. There are other ways to determine if the door bell is bad or another component BUT one would have to physically look at your door bell itself to see how that door bell button is configured. Mainly because this tester is basically a light bulb with a clip and a probe attached to it. As such it needs a positive voltage on either the probe or the clip and a negative or return on the other. Were you to connect this to your door bell all you would be doing would be connecting it to 2 points on the same positive wire as the negative( which you have to have in order for the tester light to come on) is a straight wire that goes from the ringer back to the door bell transformer BUT it might be behind the door bell winger. A typical door bell has 2 wires that when the door bell is pressed make a physical connection and allow the low voltage ( 6 to 28volts) to pass thru the button and go to the bell- ringer- chime and that makes noise. These hand held testers like this are generally used around automobiles & such where the negative (return) is the car battery which is physically connected to the vehicle body and you can attach the clip to any clean metal surface. Door bell buttons usually outlast the other parts of the system... Transformer and chimes typically go bad first."

If the 14.4v 1.5Ah agrees, and the shape and part-numbers look very similar, you're probably okay. In 2008 I got a pair of aftermarket battery packs to replace the original DeWalt DW9092 14.4v battery packs that worked with my DW 954-2 Drill and DW9107 Charger (14.4v 1.5Ah). They came in boxes from Batteryprice.com Labeled \"For Dewalt DE9091, DBP-144 NiCad\". Somewhere I saw a reference \"DW9092 Discontinued.\" There were \"Standard\" and \"High Capacity\" packs in my user manual. Best advice: Contact the after-market seller, with your old DeWalt drill, battery-pack and charger ID-NUMBERS, and have them verify the replacement battery-pack is an exact replacement for your DeWalt original battery-pack."

If you feel you need complete coverage with no gaps, then I suggest the 5 foot fencing. You will have about 7 inches of left over material which you can fold up and tack to the fence or leave it on the ground.

        "answer": "Is the compressor running or just the fan/coil unit after the temperature is reached? Does it cut off after a couple of minutes? If it just keeps running, it sounds like it might have been wired incorrectly, assuming the \"Fan\" switch isn't in the \"On\" position (if it is, switch it to the \"Auto\" position). If it just continues to run for a couple of minutes, I think the thermostat is likely programmed to do that as a (mildly misguided) effort at efficiency by taking advantage of the low refrigerant temperature that lingers a bit after the compressor has shut off. I actually don't have this model (and am not sure why Amazon thinks I do), and I am going from the behavior of the model TX5000Ua that I do have."

        "answer": "Originally, High Sierra Showerheads were not equipped with the Splash Guard. It was added later after feedback from some customers indicated that some very small droplets that break away from the main part of the spray were bothersome. These wayward droplets don't contribute to the force of the spray because they are so few, but they can fall outside the tub depending on the height of the shower head. With the Splash Guard the effective spray is really not narrower than the without, but the Splash Guard works like a choke on a shotgun and pushes the wayward droplets back into the spray. For that reason, I usually recommend the Splash Guard for home use. The effective spray width of both models measures about 6 \" at 1 ft from the shower head and increases to 18\" at 5 to 6 ft."

But the 3-way install is a little trickier because you can't just use a standard 3-way switch on the other side from the timer. Step 4C of the instructions clearly shows how to install this. Both the timer(located with the LOAD connections) and the remote(which is located with the LINE connections) require a neutral wire. You should be able to download the instruction sheet from Leviton's web site and review all this before you buy. First time I wired it in I screwed it up.

        "answer": "This grinder with the proper cutting wheel would allow you to cut a V-shapped channel in your concrete. keep in mind that without a good straight edge to follow you will have a hard time creating a clean V-channel with this tool. Consider renting a concrete slab cutter and cutting out for a trench drain. Most tool rental places can instruct you on which tool to use and their general operation. Another option to consider would be putting a re-fabricated transition strip to create a similar effect to the V-Channel but with no concrete cutting."

The nv90 is cheaper so I figured I would give it a shot. Happy so far. I gram houses for a living so it does get used daily. Hope this helps"

Use a recommended filter ,or once a year it is simple enough to remove the unit and flush out the core in vinegar or a Lime-Away type product .And you won't lose that extra bit of pressure that the water filter can cause .Mine is well into its second year of use with no problems at all ,once I tuned it to my needs :)"

Drill bit kits are pretty inexpensive and you can usually get real good deals on Amazon, Sears, Home Depot websites. This a great drill for the price. It is pretty powerful and the battery does not have to be charged that often with light to medium use."

        "answer": "Responding to your question not only as a very satisfying customer and user, but also as an old retired electrical engineer [ MSEE '71, Caltech ], I can tell you the following based on my understanding/perception of the ELECTRONIC DESIGN OF THIS CLASS OF LED LIGHT BULBS : They must have built-in micro-electronic power-converters to allow the conversion of our 115 Vac household power to about 3 Vdc power that's right for turning on an LED .. If the night light holder has an 'electronic light-sensing AUTO on/of' switch function, it may not be in sync, or compatible, with this LED lamp and many others; and thus, FLASHING results. I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THIS PROBLEM, TOO. My solution: Knowing that these LED lamps will last a long time while burning very little juice, I SIMPLY USE A MECHANICALLY-SWITCHED LAMP HOLDER FOR THEM, AND LEAVE THEM 'ON' 24/7 . .. Then, I remain to be a happy camper."

        "answer": "Hello Scott. Woodworkers vices like this one are mounted under the bench with the top edge of the jaws flush with the top surface of the bench. If you have something that you want to lay flat on the bench and hold with the clamp, the outer (moving) jaw has a \"dog\" that slides up to protrude above the bench surface. To hold the other end of the piece, you would use bench dogs that slide down into holes in the bench top (typically 3/4\" diameter). Here is an example of the bench dogs, and similar ones can be bought elsewhere, like Rockler's. http://www.amazon.com/Kreg-Tool-Company-KKS1070-Bench/dp/B006Q8TN4O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1372190882&sr=8-3&keywords=bench+dog"

The EZ-45 connector has perforations that allow the conductors to pass through the connector body, inspected and pulled taught prior to crimping. The Platinum crimper has an extra blade that then snips the excess length off of the conductor at the completion of the crimp cycle.

However, it is made very well.....I can safely say it is the nicest one I have ever bought. So the bowl actually juts out about half an inch. I still like it but that could bother someone else.

Not sure if the Ultra has changed that much between 2000 and 2014, but Amazon is usually really good about accepting returns if it doesn't. My husband really likes his and the price was very reasonable. He especially likes the fact that the center pouch is bigger than most, on on others. I hope my info has helped you. Good Luck!"

        "answer": "I am no pro but I am a \"handy\" female and I installed one this weekend. Mounting was so easy it should not be a worry and The outside Tankless heater does not need venting so that was a big plus for me. There are Three things you must check you have before you start: #1 Must have 3/4 inch gas line (check for your model) for this model. I upgraded mine by replacing the T at the main pipe (Tankless needs the capacity so no cheating by using a reducer to size up from smaller capacity). #2 Must Get the Tankless Water Heater Service Valve Kit or you will not be able to service/clean it and save yourself heartache (it will break easier than standard HW heaters if not serviced regularly) I got mine at HD. #3 Needs 110 v electricity (I put in a light switch outside and put outside cover over it so we could turn it on/off as needed). One thing everyone should be aware of that can be a gotcha: There is a sensor which will not allow the unit start until all gas/water/electricity are hooked up and if you do try to start it before then (such as when trying to test the electricity to the thermostat like me), their is a sensor that will not allow it to start until everything is hooked up. The thermostat may not come on after doing this. It needed to be reset by turning the electricity to it on and off; I just used the GFI on the outlet on this electrical run to turn the electricity off and then back on to do a easy disconnection/reconnection of the electricity to thermostat which did the trick. The thermostat came back to life and it worked. Now my tenant is enjoying hot water. This guys installation videos were excellent and where I learned about the valves! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKhXoaRg6k4 Hope this helps. I will be getting mine inspected by the city as part of an existing permit for a remodel. Let you know if anything comes up after that, but it should not."

In my review, I also warned readers that when I attempted to remove a sticker from a lovely wall shelf, it took the finish completely off, so I feared it would ruin the carpet. However, I happened to have a piece of carpet. I sprayed a bit of red paint on it, let it dry and then tried Goof-Off. It did not damage the carpet but it did not remove the red paint at all. I would try rubbing some paint thinner on the spot with a stiff brush, followed by some soapy water on a sponge. This has worked for me in the past."

The airline tracks system can handle quite a load, probably easily the securing force for a canoe (even if the force is going a near-0 angle) if you don't mount it on your roof in a way the wind catches it to pull it upwards. If you use glue (polyurethane) and the supplied counterpieces, the tracks shouldn't be the problem - I would be more worried about the shell cracking if it's thin fibreglass."

        "answer": "It does NOT operate on demand. Plug it in and it runs. Remove the plug and it shuts off. As long as you have it in water the suction remains constant. Having said all that, I love this pump. My only problem is that it is sooo heavy. I use it mainly to empty my 150 gal fish tank prior to cleaning and to empty my grandchildrens' 15' swimming pool every Fall. I just attach a long hose to the pump and water my garden flowers until the pool is empty. Only once did it give me a problem and that was when I took the protective screen off the intake and it sucked up a large piece of gravel from the fish tank. Something broke inside. But my son went up to Lowe's for a little part and it was good as new. You must remember to prime it before use by putting some water in it. I would definitely buy another one if necessary but I wouldn't be surprised if it outlived me. I'm 70. I suppose that what you would use it for would determine how well it would work for you. For me it's perfect. Good luck."

        "answer": "I've used these faucet filters before, and the manufacturers tend to be pretty optimistic about the life of the filter. Also, the two months quoted is really an estimate because it depends on the condition of your water and how much you use the filter. I haven't had mine long enough here in Florida to get an idea of how long it will last, but I'm pretty careful about only using it for drinking water. From my experience, I'd say a month on a filter is within the 'normal' range. Btw (and I'm not sure if it mentions this in the little manual), I've read that running hot or even warm water through them kills the filter prematurely. The good news is this one has made a huge improvement in the taste of my water, so I have to assume it's doing its job!"

Both types depend on gravity to close them. Be sure both flappers are installed correctly for the gravity assist. My guess is the primary problem is the \"outside\" vent flapper. Try another type of \"dryer \" vent. If that doesn't work try a baffle around the vent to disturb the air flow. When we get the strong Santa Ana winds here in Southern California, I can hear the wind slightly when standing under the unit even though the vent pipe run is about 12 feet from the unit to the outside vent. I do not get any \"blowback\" in air through the unit, nor does the flap in the unit \"flap\" open and closed with the strong winds. If your flappers are installed properly to take advantage of gravity, then a baffle around the outside vent to disturb the airflow may be your best bet."

        "answer": "Absolutely no hum noise. Regarding brightness, it's a bit of a trick question. As you can configure the color, using a very cold color has higher lumens, and would replace a 60W with warmer color (lower lumens). But at equal color, you would notice the difference. Precisely in my case, for a living room, it did not adequately replace 60W & 75W equivalent bulbs, I had to put two Hue bulbs in some cases instead of one CFL. But FYI one working trick is to replace in a living room most bulbs with Hue ones, and keep a few (like some ceiling lights) regular high-watt bulbs. At the end of the day, you don't need super bright light all the time, but usually only from time to time. So you turn on the regular bulbs only when you need really bright light in your room."

It is reasonably quiet, even on its \"full power\" setting. In short, I have been very happy with it after over two years of very heavy use. Powermatic recommends two units if being used in a \"very large\" area, but their website and manual don't quantify that.

        "answer": "I own one and I love it! First thing to check is the temperature adjustment knob under the unit is turned fully clockwise. The temperature rise can vary widely based upon that and other things, such as... the incoming water temperature, the flow in GPM (consider the flow all fixtures whixh are being used at the same time if more than one are... the higher the flow rate, the lower the water temperate rise. Also, if yours is a 240VAC unit and your actual voltage is less like 220VAC it won't warm water as much as 240 does. If your faucets, etc. are too far from the heater... some heat can be lost in the run of pipe, especially if it is in a cold area. Note that what causes thermal shutdowns to occur is overtemp, this can happen if the flow is restricted quite a bit, but high enough to activate the heater, and when the incoming water temp is very high. Also never try to connect this type of heater to water the is already preheated. I have some AE9.5 units as well and I know they have the thermal shutdown, I think all Bosch units do."

Under a saw load the contractor's TS will flex a bit resulting in an untrue cut. Still, the Incra miter gauge will remove a lot of slop in your current miter gauge and make your miter cuts truer. The Incra will also last a long time and you may find use for it in a cabinet model TS that by design yields truer cuts. I just don't think you can go wrong with this Incra miter gauge."

Water would simply run in through the sides of the box as well as the hole where the anchor cable attaches. I suspect the hinge and lock would likewise not last long in a damp/wet environment unless they were periodically treated and lubricated. You might want to look at Pelican cases - they are waterproof and have lock attachment points. I'm sure a cable could be added to secure it to a fixture."

        "answer": "Yes, I use compact fluorescents in mine. The glass is frosted. Because the shade is a camel color, the fluorescents don't throw off the stark white light that they normally do. It gives off a nice warm light even using the CFLs. Hope this helps!"

The lightbulb itself has a blue tinge but that doesn't mean it gives a blue light. You know how some bulbs give everything a yellow cast? These bulbs bring out the true color of everything by providing a full spectrum of light, not just partial and they're not garish and harsh like LED or CFL. Hope that helps."

If you do this, then you pull the handle out towards you to turn the water on, then pivot from left to right for temperature adjustment. I still have the 180-ish degree of motion to swivel the unit from side to side. Plus, when you install the handle facing forward, it's much easier to clean spills and a sticky handle too, and you can clearly see which side to turn the handle for hot and cold--great for visiting non-USA guests!"

We are going to use the Linksys SPA3102, since we have used it many times to do similar things in the past and it is very programmable. It is an advanced configuration, not something a novice VoIP admin will figure out.

        "question": "What's the difference in the FC350B and the FR350B? I am researching as a Christmas present for my handyman husband's first pneumatic nailer?",
        "answer": "The C stands for \"Clipped\" and the R stands for \"Round\". That designates what type of nail can be used in the nailer. The clipped nails have heads that are shaped like a \"D\", whereas the round are shaped like an \"O\", logically. For the user, this means a few things. The clipped heads can be stacked with the shafts much closer, as the clipped side of the nail doesn't interfere with the shaft of the next nail. This means you can fit more nails in the nailer, and thus less reloading. The advantage of the round head nail is that the head is slightly larger, and thus less likely to be pulled through the board when the structure is put under stress. I researched this a bit, and most contractors (I'm a DIYer, like your husband) seemed to feel that they didn't notice a difference in the strength. I've never had an issue with it myself, and I've done remodel work in both my home and some commercial property my wife and I own. One last thing to consider is local building code. In some areas, code requires round head nails. This is mainly in the southeast coastal areas. The concern is hurricanes could stress structures to the point where the nail head will make a difference. Sorry for being long-winded. If you are interested in more information/opinions, just google \"clipped vs round head framing nailer\" and you will find all kinds of debates. Good luck, I'm sure he'll love it. I know I do!"

I used a cup to scoop out the rest of the water then used a towel to get anything left. Unscrew the two screws in the bottom of the tank and lift the tank off. There is rubber gasket between the tank and the bowl- DO NOT THROW THIS OUT as this kit does not come with that gasket. Using the provided tool take off the large nut that holds the valve on. replace the valve and use the tool to tight. Put the other gasket in the hole and place the tank on the bowl. Fasten it with the screws and tighten. Replace the water intake. That's it... if things go well, about a half hour."

The SmartBridge connects them through your Insteon Hub and allows you to get notifications on your phone via text and/or email remotely if an alarm sounds. Without the SmartBridge they will communicate with each other locally inside your home which helps make sure an alarm in one area of your house is heard throughout your house."

I put a wood dowell taped to the end and on nice weekends I roll the plastic with the dowell and tie it to the top of the window.

The 880LM is a digital upgrade and I use it as a second controller in my garage that has two entry doors. The 888LM upgrades older liftmasters to the increased features on the new models...I.e. adds a motion sensor for turning on lights and adds capability to auto close the door if you don't hit the hold button. The Amazon descriptions got me confused, but the liftmaster service desk got me right on track. I have 3 openers...two are the old technology and the newest is the digital opener that i used the 880LM on. I upgraded one of my older openers with the 888LM."

To remove the steel one just find a flat head screw driver that fits in one of the squiggly slots and turn left and it should work loose. If you have the plastic lock then you need to get a good pair of dikes or side cutting pliers and just grab that succor and twist. Try it.

        "question": "All the talk about Dual action and orbital, What is really best? Why is a orbital so different (other than speed control) than the old buffer/polisher",
        "answer": "Depends really on what your ultimate goal is for what you are doing. Rotarys require some skill to master if you do not know what you are doing you can cause some serious damage even with a foam pad and polish. However, rotaries also have the ability to work much faster and remove more severe defects from the surface. You can get a flawless finish with a rotary with the correct pad and polish. Now, if you are new to polishing and sick of doing things by hand a DA polisher is the tool for you. If you get somthing like a porter cable or meguiars it is a non forced rotation. What this means is when too much pressure is applied the pad will stop rotating and just vibrate on the surface. DA's are great for getting flawless finishes on decent paint . They excel at removing swirls and light oxidation with NO buffer marks. If you need speed the rotary is the way to go. I have both the porter cable and makita. I prefer the rotary, but if you are just a hobbyist i recommend a DA polisher. They are safer and you will get a better finish if your skill level is low."

I'm actually using it for the moisture content of coffee-beans at differing stages of processing/drying, up to green coffee for roasting. Coffee beans are similar in size to Soy-beans, so I use that setting. There are settings for rice, wheat,.... I've compared the readouts to known samples and they're close enough for my purposes. It'll give both temperature and percent humidity readings of bagged seeds, and seems more accurate if the bags are stacked, so that the grain is \"compressed.\" Read the instruction guide. I believe it takes an indirect measurement of the grain by measuring electrical resistance/conductivity of the grain sample. Kind of like a soil-meter."

I have learned to accept that fact and work around it because it is still far easier than having to clean the machines off of all the dust and dirt (and rust) that accumulate on the machine since mine are outside. Having said that I do not fully remove the covers when using the machines. I simply lift up the front and pull it over just enough to open the door. For the washer, since the door is on top, it holds the cover open without any problem. For the dryer, I use the heavy detergent bottle to sit it on top holding the cover open. I then left up and over to access the knobs, and put it back when done. In order to be able to do this, I do not use the provided straps to tie the covers down, but since it is not windy enough where I live, I don't need them."

        "question": "I am powering this off a motion sensor and it has a lot of buzzing/clicking when on. I remove the motion sensor, it works fine. What am i doing wrong?",
        "answer": "Andy - I connected my contactor to a Variac and measured the coil current. I measured the following: Pull-in current 145mA to 155mA. Sustaining current 60mA. Drop out current about 30 mA. The solenoid buzzed really badly if the available current was LESS than 145 mA at pull-in, which leads me to believe that your problem is the output driver on the motion sensor can't provide enough current to pull the contactor in. You can measure the sensor output current to the contactor coil by CAREFULLY connecting a multimeter, set to the 10 amps AC scale, in series with your coil drive circuit, and monitor the amount of current it's putting out while the contactor buzzes. Be careful, 120 volts. If your driver can't provide the current to drive the contactor, one way around this would be to use a second, smaller relay to pull in the bigger contactor. Typical \"ice-cube\" 120v coil relays just require ~ 10-20 mA to pull in. Then this small relay's contacts could activate the coil of the larger contactor. If your motion sensor is providing the proper current then the problem may be related to noise, but I'd check your driver circuit's current capability first. Greg Walz greenlite350@aol.com"

This extension table rests between the new guide rails on four supplied steel supports. I've had no problems no problems at all. I should point out, though, that unless you have adequate experience or access to someone who does, you may want to check Vega's website to see if a copy of the instructions can be downloaded for you to examine and see if the systyem appears adaptable to your particular saw and if you are up to the task of installing it.

        "question": "Is this tool what I would use to close silver rings on a charm bracelet?",
        "answer": "Soldering is a confusing topic for people who are new jewelry making. There are two totally different ways to solder that use different types of soldering equipment, but few people ever specify which method they're talking about. Solder is a metal alloy which you melt to coat or connect metal pieces - if it helps, think of solder as hot metal glue. The act of soldering is melting and applying solder. The two aforementioned methods of soldering are soldering with a torch and soldering with a soldering iron.Torch soldering is also known as \"hard soldering,\" \"brazing,\" or \"silver soldering\" even though brass, copper, gold, and other metals can be soldered with a torch. There are multiple grades of hard solder - soft, medium, and hard - which melt at different temperatures. You can solder base metals, like pewter, and plated metals with a soldering iron, which is known as soft soldering. Soft solder has a relatively low melting point. Never use a soldering iron to work on precious metals because you will ruin the jewelry. Silver and gold jewelry must be torch soldered. Successful soldering involves heating the metal pieces - not just melting the solder - meaning that if a piece of jewelry is large or thick, chances are it was torch soldered. Soldering irons are not all the same. There are a wide variety of irons available, but the majority are not designed for making jewelry. The most important features to look for are wattage and the type of tip. Look for a sixty-watt chisel-tip soldering iron (you can also buy soldering iron tips separately). Soldering irons with pointy tips are designed for small electronics like circuit boards and aren't appropriate for working with jewelry, unless you replace the tip. Soldering irons with fewer than sixty watts may not heat up sufficiently. Use lead-free solid-core solder and avoid solder with acid or rosin cores. Solder needs flux, which is sometimes included with solder, to melt and flow."

The rotorary tools actually have a much faster RPM, or most of them, and the wheels would cut much better with an actual rotory tool. But to answer your question; the answer is yes, but you may not like the results because it would be very slow."

        "answer": "I had THREE (3) lighthouses; not because I wanted or needed three, but because none of these worked and their very excellent, most responsive customer service rep -in Calif., I think- kept replacing the inoperative product -the WHOLE lighthouse! Frankly I do not recall any battery being associated with the lighthouse itself or in the on/off stake. The fixture was completely solar is my best recollection. I could be wrong. I believe instructions called for the on/off to be in the \"on\" position while the solar plate was exposed to the sun over a day or so to collect and store energy for nighttime illumination. But not one of the lighthouses worked. I believe the wiring was too delicate to withstand the trip from China. What I did was to purchase a $10 solar spotlight from Walmart which I \"jimmyrigged\" into the lighthouse tower replacing the inoperative parts. This approached worked beautifully and was further enhanced by the purchase of another Walmart spotlight which I positioned to illuminate the whole lighthouse, illuminated tower included. Really quite beautiful in our backyard!"

I understand your concern about not knowing if everything is in the kit or not. However, it is extremely rare that one should arrive with missing parts. There is, unfortunately, no way around it other than unwrapping the paracord. I have never had a customer claim that anything was missing out of a survival kit so there shouldn't be any need to worry! Of course, if there did happen to be anything missing, we'd be more than happy to make it right by you :) If there is anything else we can help you with, please feel free to contact us at the customer service link below. Thanks! Best, Kendall / The Friendly Swede"

If you don't, you can get a back up of exhaust in your house, cause damage to the heater, and quite possibly cause a fire. It is not that difficult to change the vent pipe.

Or, since the tool is stainless you can also try soaking it in warm, soapy water for a while. Once you get the tool opened up, THEN souse 'er down good with the WD-40.

        "answer": "It's not a good idea, but technically yes. The remotes and the receivers have dip switches on them. As long as the settings on both are the same, the remote will control the fan. Therefore, if you have two fans with two receivers that both have the same settings as a single remote, it would operate both of them. However, I wouldn't assume it will control them in unison, especially if both fans are not perfectly within line of sight of each other. For that reason I would recommend a second remote (you can use the same type; it would just be controlled with a different setting). Regardless of that, will it work? Yes."

So these are quite a bit brighter. And work fine in night light fixtures. I have 6 night lights in my home. I use them instead of having to turn on lamps. I do leave my night lights on all the time ( 24/7 ) They do not effect my electric bill at all. Hope this helps. God Bless YOU."

The measurements are: Width = 2.75\", Height = 6\" and the depth = 3\" when stuffed full. The back side has a webbed belt loop securely sewn on and has a metal belt clip riveted onto that. This gives you the option of putting your belt through the loop or just sliding it onto a belt for quick removal. Very versatile pouch with several pockets. The front flap comes down almost all the way. The clip for keys or what ever is still exposed but all the pockets are covered. Hope this helps."

        "answer": "Steve, I just discovered the adjustment pot for zeroing (or at least get it close to spec) the DC clamp current. Turn the meter over, then open and remove the battery cover. On the back you will find two holes to the left of the center chassis screw. The hole closest to that center chassis screw locates the adjustment pot for the DC clamp current mode. Turn the pot clockwise to decrease the value towards negative, counter-clockwise to increase the value towards positive. Use a miniature Phillips #1 (3mm shaft) screwdriver. See the photo I uploaded."

I'm not sure how you would mount this in a wall. The only holes for mounting are in the bottom. The instructions indicated that you could mount it on a shelf, which doesn't seem very secure to me. Regardless of where or how you intend to install it, I would not buy this safe. In my case, a thief pried the door open without any real effort. The lock mechanism broke without any real damage to the door. Save your money and buy something better. Good luck."

Aluminum is a real pain and TIG is the only way to go if you want it to hold. For what it is it is not bad and not needing to haul a tank around makes it handy but this welder is not meant for any sort of serious welding. You can get a stick welder for light aluminum jobs for around the same money and if you are new to welding get extra aluminum sticks and practice on scrap first."

The glasses are geared more towards cat owners since cats spray on areas other than the carpets which can be hard to spot but depending on the type of carpet and color dog owners can benefit from using them as well. A common theme you will notice as you look through the reviews of all the UV lights is most of the complaints are from dog owners. UV works on 'dry' urine and the combination of phosphor, proteins, salt and blood in the urine. Kidney function and water intake will also influence how well the urine will show. For these reasons cat urine usually shows better than dog urine with the UV. Please let us know if you have any additional questions and these type of questions are also answered in the \"Quick Start Guide\" that is emailed to you when your item ships along with a hard copy that is included with your kit."

        "answer": "I have not tried feeding one into the other, mine are in parallel with a common output feed, but feeding it into series might work. If I did try the series, I would set them up separately, and make the load on each the same, then apply them into series. The thing you will need to be very careful of on an amplifier is what kind of Amperage are you pulling on the amp? In my experience with them, these can handle up to 4-5 amps without an issue, but over that, you may find that you would be happier with a bigger unit. Also, make sure that you have a meter handy, as there is no other way to know the output in the board itself. If you decide to use these, and start making adjustments to the pod, it is an extremely fine adjustment ratio, you may turn 2 or 3 revolutions to get 1 or 2 volts, so if you start adjusting, and don't see the meter moving much, keep turning, it will eventually move."

Some customers like the door knockers, others like a contemporary handle, such as #1072 on our website. Both of the handles that we have listed on Amazon, would match those hinges you purchased, but again it is purely what you personally would like to see on your garage door.

But you could even leave just a couple chain links and have it almost right up against the ceiling. For aesthetics, you can also trim down the power cord so that there's not a lot of slack hanging over the chandelier. Unfortunately there's not a lot of space in the dome for all the extra cord, so if you're hanging close the ceiling, you will most likely have to trim the cord. The downside to cutting the cord is that if you ever want to hang the chandelier lower, you might not have enough cord length remaining, so just keep that in mind."

Left many messages via phone and emails past 3 months. NOTHING!!!!! I had to break down and take it in to a local repair facility to have it checked out on my own dime. Now it is fixed.

        "answer": "There actually weren't any directions that came with the stickers, unfortunately. We had to figure it out ourselves. What you need to do... and hopefully I can explain this as simply as possible... is peel the back sticker off and stick the sticker to the wall with the top coat still attached. Once you have the ticker on the wall how you like it, use a paint scraper and push against the top sticker to press the letters on the wall. While pushing the scraper across the top film part, pull it up slowly so that the letters will stick to the wall instead of coming up with the top part. Does that make sense??"

        "answer": "I'm no home electrician, but as an auto electrical tech I'm pretty good with wiring. So if I understand this correctly the L14-30 on the cable is going into the L14-30 on the box, and you want the L14-20 on the other end of the cable will be going into a gen or other power unit, correct? This would work as far as the connecting everything.... meaning the ends will all fit together. The problem is Amps. The L14-30's are rated at 2X30 amp lines with 1 shared ground and 1 shared common, where the L14-20 is only rated at 2X20 amp power lines with common and ground. I don't know that this would be to code first off so I have to add the disclaimer \"check with a licensed electrician\". As far as \"in theory\", yes, this would work as far as getting power from point A to B. But your box is rated at 30 amps with a full load(all breakers on), your L14-20 is only 20 amps. So while in an emergency you could provide power to the box, you would never have enough amperage to turn all the breakers on at once without risking an overload. I'd also like to add, That you will need to know how your box is wired to \"safely turn breakers on without overloading\". Since you have 2 poles feeding the breakers, you will only have 20 amps available PER POLE or per wire. Its not like some think 2X20 means I can turn 40 amp worth of breakers on, you will be limited to 20 amps per wire or you could/will blow the safety (if equipped) on the gen. You can not just assume the left side is one (pole) or wire and the right side the other. Sometimes they are and sometimes they are not. Also keeping in mind that double breakers pull from both sides or wires at once. Hope this helps and feel free to contact me or ask another question. If I can help I will."

However, I will say that I weight 174 pounds and when climbing a tree I jammed the hammer head/spike crossways in the notch of a branch above my head and it held my entire body weight with no problem.

In the worst case, if it runs in a room that stays completely dark 24 hours a day (e.g., never shuts off), for 30.25 days a month it will consume about 6.3 cents of electric power per month, assuming that you pay about 11 cents per kilowatt hour including taxes (as I do). The calculation is .8 watts * 24 hours * 30.25 days / 1000 watts (kilowatt) * .11 (the cost of a kilowatt hour). Your actual cost will probably be something less, because light in the room will shut the light off for some part of the day, and some light in the room will cause the device to dim and thereby also use less power than the .8 watt that it is rated at."

You'll see a green plastic device and a small black rubber ring; they appear to be integrated into the base of the shower head and can't be removed. So what I did is use a common nail (I had some galvanized 10D 3 inch nails in the garage) and, using a hammer, gently punched a hole right into the center of the green plastic piece. Then, using a pair of tweezers, I was able to completely remove all of the green plastic pieces. Be careful that the pieces don't enter into the shower head itself. Put the screen back in place (this prevents particles in your water from entering and clogging the shower head) and screw the shower head back on."

        "answer": "Hi Aaron. This would NOT be very appropriate for that. This filter just stops particulates - basically dust, dirt, maybe pollen, any particle that floats in the air. The filter you want to use for painting and cleaning is termed with \"organic vapor\". Search for the product named \"3M 6001 Organic Vapor Cartridge\". That's the type of filter to use for most types of chemical vapors. (Always be sure to read the fine print though.) But that will work for typical cleaning and painting. I personally use that one, and it works really well. (Make sure when you're done to store the organic vapor ones in an air-tight ziploc bag to prolong their life.)"

        "answer": "There are two weighting curves, A and C. A weighting tends to disregard the bass, but is the legal standard, i.e. laws specifying the threshold for legal action are usually written for A weighting. In practice I have found that some meters respond more to low frequencies than others, both meters using C weighting. Strictly speaking this shouldn't happen, but weighting standards may allow quite a few decibels of \"slop\" around the specified weighting curve at high and low frequency extremes."

        "answer": "In my opinion - and it's only an opinion, as I'm not a licensed electrician - is that is more dependent on the circuit that operates the spotlights. As long as the circuit can manage the power going to those floods, then this switch is simply there to time the on/off aspect. There may actually be a limit to the amount of electricity you can send through the switch, but I doubt that a normal application would exceed that limit. Personally, I use this to operate a bathroom fan that acts as our fresh air return system for a small (1,200 sq.ft.) home. After tightening up the house with recent energy upgrades, and moving to sealed combustion for furnace and water heater, I needed a way to regularly cycle the air in the house. This switch works like a charm with up to 50 on/off points programmable for a single day, and the option to have a full 7-day schedule."

When using the Slow Automatic mode (S position) to perform the test, the user has more time to watch the light sequence and ensure that the same LEDs illuminate on the Master and Remote simultaneously. Other than allowing an extra moment to view the results, there is no advantage to the S mode. Hope this helps"

        "answer": "It probably depends on the type of plastic but I have used it on a couple of different types and let it seep into the crack while flexing the plastic a little bit to aid the penetration. On one (a liquid soap dispenser that was thoroughly cleaned) I also added some clear epoxy at the end of the crack for strength. Both projects are still holding well. In both cases I figured I had nothing to lose by trying. Good luck."

Basically, when the float 'triggers' the switch to run (ie power on), it is programmed to automatically run for about 10 seconds, then it shuts off the power again.

        "answer": "You can usually dilute latex paint up to 10%, but the risk of sagging increases with the percentage. However, it's best to use a larger nozzle with a product called Floetrol and minimize the water. It is not a replacement for water. It helps the paint flow better and allows you to use less water. How much? Depends on a lot of things but paint temperature and nozzle size are to key factors. For this gravity-fed sprayer, you really should do it at room temperature, with a 1.7 - 2.5-mm nozzle. Add the Floetrol as directed (8-16 oz per gallon). You'll need a larger screen because latex is thick and will clog up regular ones. Then spray from about 6-8 inches away. These are just starting points; you'll need to find out what works best for you."

On my set, the knob on the inner knob has a little twistable part in the center that can be moved vertically or horizontally to lock or unlock the knobs. The deadbolt is keyed on both sides though. the problem with these knob sets is that, as other buyers have mentioned, anyone with an adventurous nature could buy a set and may be able to open your door with their keys. Eventhough you get max-for-min with the double set; please consider whether they are being installed on inner our outer doors. Otherwise, they were easy to install and I am no handyperson. All I used was a screwdriver. The holes were already in the door and frame, in my case. Good Luck and thanks for reading."

At best, it might be assembled in the USA.

I actually have one on order right now. If I find out I'm wrong, I'll let you know."

        "answer": "Others have mentioned that proximity between the Zee and your lock is a factor. This is partially correct, because a Z-Wave network is a \"mesh\" network, in that other devices have the ability to act as repeaters. You could say that the more Z-Wave components you have, the better all of it should work (in theory). In my house, I have two other Z-Wave components in between my Zee and my door lock (mine is a Yale). I've never had a connectivity issue. I DO NOT have the ability to program the door lock (entry codes, etc) through the interface of the HomeSeer API. Nope. I do this on the lock itself. We have four codes set up on ours. You asked about text messages when the door is unlocked by a specific person (code). YES, this is possible via the Zee's HS3 software, in a way. What is actually happening is the Zee sends an email, not a text message. However, most wireless providers have a function where an email can be sent as a text message. This is how I accomplish the notification that my wife and I both receive via SMS whenever our teenager uses his code to unlock the door. Here is an example of the above on AT&T's network: http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB63037&cv=820#fbid=_WFfaYxxr4L"

This one has a real switch and will definitely shut off the LED. It makes a loud click when it switches and it misses about 25% of the on or off commands which might get better with a newer controller. Still working on that part."

Before applying, I cut each bird off the sheet (not along the outline, just to be able to tape them up separately) and taped them to the wall where I thought I wanted them.

I'm still getting good results at six months and don't plan on changing anytime soon cuz I live alone so it doesn't get used that often. Also installation was really easy. You won't need a plumber. You just screw it on after unscrewing your old one. I did it myself and I'm a girly girl. At most, u may need a wrench to help unscrew your old one if it's super stuck on or something but otherwise u should be good with just your hands."

If the cross is not projected perfectly plumb to the floor, the cross beams won't be square. There are certainly ways to do it with this device by manually transferring points and snapping chalk lines, but you can do the same with a tape measure and chalk line. What you need is a laser that is designed for projecting a right angle on a floor. An example would be a GTL 3."

It is best to mark your item with a fine point sharpie pen as to where you want to punch the metal--this will also help you center the punch with the mark. Look at the size of your punch and do a \"run through\" so to speak by lining up the dot to be punch and lowering the punch to see if you need to adjust where you want to center the punch. You never want to get too close to the edge as you don't want to have the hole edge to break easily. Test on some scrap metal if you are having some difficulties..it will give you a better perspective as to how close to the edge you can be. Hope this helps!"

I would have tried DRYLOK Latex Water Proofer on your patio, I use this product on my concrete steps. I use Thompsons water seal on my Bricks I coated them twice. You do not want water inside your concrete when you coat, hopefully the sun will dry out your patio."

I imagine they would do very well in a tent with a sturdy canvas type floor. I know someone who has used them for that purpose and under their air mattress, as well. They were pleased.

        "answer": "I have been using the standard 20 lb propane tanks from walmart or any other place that has standard tanks. I have never had an issue with it tripping the \"safety shut-off\" that others have mentioned. I also have the \"squeeze valve\" that lowers the flame automatically to a pilot light level, and only goes on full when you squeeze. This will lesson the chance of tripping the safety shutoff because the gas increases more slowly as you squeeze. It is also drastically safer, as the gas will lower to pilot level if you drop the torch. Overall, if I squeeze fully the flame would set anything that is within 2-3 feet of the end ablaze. It produces a relatively loud roar that sounds like a jet engine. I cannot imagine wanting a much larger flame for home or small business purposes, so I definitely would say there are no visible limitations from the regulator on the tank."

I would be very careful to plug it in the international power adapter, because there is no safe switch between 120V and 220V (like in computers or similar electronics), plus you might not get the appropriate amperage input.
